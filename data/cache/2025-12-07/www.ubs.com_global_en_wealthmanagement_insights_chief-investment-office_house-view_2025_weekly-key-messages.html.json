  "content": "Markets have become more convinced that a US rate cut is on the way at the Fed's December meeting. Will this be supported by data this week on business activity, inflation, and consumer sentiment?The tech rally resumed last week. The Nasdaq rose 4.9%, with the week capped by evidence that AI drove higher Black Friday shopping by US consumers. Can the tech rebound extend into this week?Oil prices fell to a one-month low last week. This came amid continued efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, which has the potential to boost supplies of energy from Russia. Investors will be looking for any signs of progress toward a ceasefire.Will US data add to market confidence in a December rate cut by the Fed?The Federal Reserve has been keeping investors in suspense in recent weeks over whether there will be a final rate cut for 2025 at its December meeting. There have been conflicting signals from top policymakers and mixed signals on the health of the labor market. But last week, the momentum shifted decisively back toward expectations for Fed easing. Markets ended the week pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate reduction on 10 December, when the policy meeting concludes. That’s roughly double the probability assigned to a cut just a week earlier and much higher than the 25% ascribed 10 days ago.The change in mood was partly triggered by comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who described the labor market as “vulnerable,” and from Governor Christopher Waller, who explicitly said he favored a cut in December. Weaker economic data added to the shift, with signs of labor market weakness and softening retail sales.Fed officials are in the blackout period this week, so there will be no guidance on rates or the economy from policymakers. Instead, the focus for investors will be on the data. Business activity data from ISM for November will be examined for clues on whether companies are hiring, as well as for clues on inflation pressures. Following the recent weaker retail sales data, there could also be increased interest in the Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey for December. The final reading of the November survey showed Americans had the most downbeat view of their personal finances since 2009. Finally, the Fed’s favorite measure of inflation—the personal consumption expenditure index—is released on Friday. This is for September, so it could seem quite outdated. However, investors and Fed officials will be hoping for reassurance that while inflation is about a percentage point above the central bank’s 2% target, price pressures remain under control.Our view is that the Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points more by the end of the first quarter of 2026. Against this backdrop, we are constructive on the outlook for quality bonds, where we see a positive risk-reward proposition due to attractive yields and the potential for even better returns if economic activity slows more than expected.Can the tech rebound continue? The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite last week broke a three-week losing streak, reflecting an ebbing of recent concerns over elevated tech valuations. Artificial-intelligence-powered shopping tools helped drive a jump in US online spending on Black Friday, as shoppers turned to chatbots to compare prices and secure discounts. Based on data from Adobe Analytics, AI-driven traffic to US retail sites was up 805% compared to last year, contributing to a 9.1% rise in online shopping. There was also good news for Alphabet, amid positive reviews for the latest upgrade of its Gemini AI model and demand for its AI chips—though this presented a headwind for chipmaker NVIDIA.Beneath the revival in the index, we continue to notice a shift in the market from rewarding companies for accelerating AI capital spending to focusing on cash flow. This has underlined our view that the next opportunity lies with AI users and not just enablers—the companies building AI infrastructure. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, the market caps of the AI7—NVIDIA, Broadcom, AMD, Micron, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft—have appreciated by more than USD 10 trillion, double the size of the S\u0026P 500's health care sector. Yet, companies that use AI have not seen comparable increases in valuation. This is where we see a potential opportunity: investing in companies that use AI to boost revenue and lower costs, increasing free cash flow. We believe return on investment is highest in sectors like advertising, research and development, coding, and customer service. In addition, the health care and financial sectors, which we view as Attractive, look well placed to turn AI deployment into cash flow generation.More broadly, while we expect worries over tech valuations to contribute to bouts of volatility, our view is that high multiples are justified by the outlook for strong earnings growth.What comes next for commodity markets? Commodities were back in focus last week. Oil prices fell to their lowest level in a month amid signs of progress toward a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, which could boost Russian energy supplies that have been subject to international sanctions. This week, President Trump’s special envoy is expected to travel to Moscow for further talks on ending the war, which is approaching its fourth year. Many sticking points remain in the talks. But investors will be on the alert this week for signs of a breakthrough. Our view is that an imminent end to the war remains unlikely. However, even in the event of a peace deal, we expect oil prices to be well supported—part of our broader positive view on commodities heading into 2026. Oil prices have lagged other commodities this year amid slower-than-expected demand growth and ample supply from the Americas and OPEC+. But while demand has fallen short, we don’t see a glut of supply. The recent increase in oil-on-water levels—the amount of crude that is currently being transported on ships at sea—has not translated into a build-up in on-land inventories. In fact, data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) indicates a decline. In terms of the market balance going forward, we see stalling supply growth outside OPEC + and growing global demand. As a result, we expect Brent crude oil to trade at USD 67/bbl at the end of 2026, compared to close to USD 63/bbl at the time of writing.On industrial metals—such as copper and aluminum—we expect prices to be supported by constrained supply and rising demand. Finally, we expect gold—which has started to recover from its drop in late October—to rise further as falling US interest rates erode the opportunity cost of holding the metal and central banks continue to diversify away from US dollars. So, we view commodities as Attractive.Chart of the weekThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite last week broke a three-week losing streak as valuation concerns ebbed. We have noticed a shift in the market from rewarding companies for AI capex toward a focus on cash flow, underlining our view that the next opportunity lies with AI users and not just enablers. While we expect worries over tech valuations to contribute to bouts of volatility, our view is that high multiples are justified by the outlook for strong earnings growth.Tech is recovering from November lowsS\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices, reindexed to 100",
