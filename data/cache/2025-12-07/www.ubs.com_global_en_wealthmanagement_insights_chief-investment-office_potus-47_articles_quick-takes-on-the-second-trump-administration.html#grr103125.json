The court will likely issue its ruling later this year, potentially early next year.The US government could be forced to refund USD130- 140 billion of tariff revenue (0.5% of 2024 US GDP), which would provide a modest windfall to US importers that paid the tariff but would modestly worsen the US fiscal outlook (7.9% of 2025 US federal budget deficit).We expect the administration to partially rebuild the tariff wall with other trade remedies (e.g., Sections 201, 232, 301) that are less flexible and more limited in scope. This process may take several quarters to unfold.Except for China and its rare earth leverage, we assume goods trade surplus countries won’t retaliate against new tariffs to avoid potential escalation and deeper economic damage.Rebuilding the tariff wall with more targeted levies on specific products and countries will likely spark episodes of heightened volatility in certain regional markets and sectors, but this is likely to prove short-lived if countries don’t retaliate.We think a lower US effective tariff rate and no retaliation could prove supportive for stocks by improving consumer spending power. By limiting inflation, it also allows room for more Fed funds rate cuts. The yield curve could modestly steepen as investors price a slightly worse US budget deficit outlook.US-China tariffs: De-escalation post Xi-Trump meeting\n 30 Oct 2025  |  Yifan Hu, CIO Greater China and Head Macroeconomics APAC; Kathy Li, CFA, Macro Strategist\nThe much-anticipated Xi-Trump meeting concluded today with constructive tones and outcomes. Notably, President Xi emphasized dialogue, cooperation, and long-term stability as the foundation for US-China relations, calling for mutual understanding and expanded collaboration. His remarks also appeared intended to reassure US concerns about the implications of China’s growth for the US economy.Based on Trump’s speech on Air Force One and China’s Ministry of Commerce statements, key outcomes from the latest talks include:Tariff cut: US lowers fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% and extends the reciprocal tariff truce by one year, reducing the effective rate to 30%from 40%.Soybean: China resumes US soybean purchases immediately.Rare earths: China suspends new export controls for one year, improving US access.Tech restrictions: US pauses “\u003e50% affiliate entity list rules” for one year.Shipment fees: US suspends probe and special port fees on China’s ships for one year.Future visits: Trump to visit China next April; Xi may visit the US afterward.While no final agreement was reached on TikTok, Russian oil, and Blackwell chips, the overall tone of the meeting was constructive, with both sides emphasizing consensus on resolving major trade issues. Both leaders have also agreed to continue collaboration in varied fields and further negotiations, aiming to resolve major trade issues and maintain a constructive relationship.Overall, the Xi-Trump meeting has eased immediate trade tensions and set a positive tone for further negotiations. The tariff de-escalation is in line with our base case that the tariff landing zone should be 30-40%. The details and implementation of the agreements approved by the two Presidents would be important to watch.Monitoring the economy amid a shutdown\n 3 Oct 2025  |  by Kurt Reiman, Head of Fixed Income Americas; John Murtagh, Fixed Income Analyst\nPrivate data releases help sketch the economic pictureIn our 25 September report previewing a US government shutdown, we provided a select list of October's economic data releases that would not be published in the event Congress was unable to pass a continuing resolution. Now that the data releases from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis have been paused throughout the shutdown, we highlight the private sector and Federal Reserve economic data releases that will continue to be published to provide a timely gauge of economic conditions (see Fig. 1).\n Fig. 1\nSelected monthly private economic releasesData CategoryData CategoryIndicatorIndicatorSourceSourceData CategoryConsumerIndicatorConsumer ConfidenceConsumer SentimentSourceConference BoardUniv. of MichiganData CategoryHousingIndicatorExisting Home Sales (SAAR)SourceNational Assoc. of RealtorsS\u0026P CoreLogic Case-ShillerData CategoryInflationIndicatorISM Manufacturing PricesISM Non-Manufacturing PricesSourceISMISMData CategoryEmploymentIndicatorADP Employment ChangeJob Cut AnnouncementsSourceAutomatic Data ProcessingChallenger, Gray \u0026 ChristmasData CategoryManufacturingIndicatorISM Mfg. Purchasing Manager IndexIndustrial ProductionSourceISMFederal ReserveInvestors view Fed on autopilot this month, not flying blindDespite having less visibility on the economy during the shutdown, we expect the Fed to cut the policy rate twice in the fourth quarter, each time by 25 bps—once at the end of October and again in mid-December. The market-implied probability that the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points in late October stands at 100%, with still sizable odds of an additional cut at its meeting in mid-December.As we wrote in our last report, the economic impact from US government shutdowns is usually modest—even those that stretch for several weeks. The shutdown in 2018-19 was a partial shutdown but also the longest at 34 days. It resulted in an estimated reduction in 2019 GDP of just 0.02%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The current episode may prove somewhat more disruptive than in 2018-19 because this represents the first full shutdown since 2013 (a full shutdown occurs when Congress hasn't passed any of the 12 annual appropriations bills.) CBO estimates that the furloughs could affect as many as 750,000 employees out of the just over 2 million people who work at the agencies subject to discretionary spending approvals. UBS estimates the number at closer to 550,000. Still, the two estimates represent between 0.3-0.5% of the US labor force. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget is preparing plans to fire government employees, and the administration has placed various spending programs under review during the shutdown, which could amplify the downside effects. Ultimately, these moves raise uncertainty: The number of employees who would be affected is not yet known, and, as with the DOGE firings and spending cuts earlier in the year, these moves would likely be subject to litigation.A potential endgameThe economic effect of the shutdown also hinges on its duration, but it's impossible to know how long the stalemate in Congress will last. At issue is the expiry at the end of 2025 of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which Democrats are seeking to extend in any continuing resolution. Historically, extended government shutdowns yield little for the party forcing the shutdown. In the failed Tuesday vote to pass a continuing resolution, three Democrats voted in favor of keeping the government open, while one Republican voted against. This yielded a 55-45 outcome, five votes shy of the necessary 60 vote threshold to move the legislation forward. If Senate Majority Leader Thune is able to pick up at least five more Democratic votes, most likely either Senate moderates or those representing purple districts, the shutdown will end.US government shutdown on the horizon\n 25 Sep 2025  |  by Kurt Reiman, Head of Fixed Income Americas; Leslie Falconio, Head of Taxable Fixed Income Strategy, CIO Americas; Matthew Tormey, CIO Equity Strategist, US Equities; John Murtagh, Fixed Income Analyst\nA looming US government shutdownA US government shutdown next week appears highly likely, in our view. Congress has not approved any of the 12 fiscal 2026 annual appropriations bills and is unlikely to pass a short-term funding package (known as a continuing resolution) before the fiscal year ends on 30 September. Continuing resolutions have been used more frequently to fund the government when legislators are unable to pass appropriations bills and agree on the budget. In the current highly charged political climate and with narrow majorities in both chambers, lawmakers appear unwilling to make the concessions needed to fund the government. Barring a last-minute, bipartisan effort to end the stalemate, a shutdown of the government would begin on 1 October. This seems unlikely with Congress out of session for the remainder of this week; the Senate returns to DC on 29 September and the House is scheduled to return on 6 October.The practical effects of a shutdownAt risk in a shutdown are the discretionary spending categories (e.g., education, transportation, defense) that are subject to annual appropriations, or roughly 25% of federal spending. Not all workers and agencies would be affected. If the 2023 shutdown contingency plans are used as a guide for this year, roughly a third of federal workers would be furloughed. Of those who would continue to work, about half would receive full pay, while the other half would work without pay. Employees would receive their pay when the shutdown ends and the funding gap is closed, mostly likely when the two sides are able to agree to some form of a continuing resolution. Meanwhile, essential services (those that are viewed as protecting life and property) would continue. Mandatory spending (outlays not affected by annual appropriations such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, income security programs and retirement benefits) would also proceed without interruption. Interest on the debt will continue to be paid, as would Treasury auctions.Economic data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (monthly inflation and employment reports, as well as weekly jobless claims), Bureau of Economic Analysis (GDP, personal income and spending), and the Census Bureau (retail sales, housing starts) would be suspended during the shutdown (see Fig. 1). Federal Reserve and private sector economic data would continue to be published during a shutdown, but the lack of data during the shutdown would constrain monetary policymakers from seeing the evolution of the economy ahead of the FOMC’s 28-29 October meeting at a time when the impact of tariffs could begin to come into focus.\n Fig. 1\nSelected government data releases during Oct 2025DateDateEconomic releaseEconomic releasePeriodPeriodDate2 OctEconomic releaseInitial Jobless ClaimsPeriod27 SepDate2 OctEconomic releaseFactory OrdersPeriodAugDate2 OctEconomic releaseDurable Good OrdersPeriodAug FDate3 OctEconomic releaseEmployment SituationPeriodSepDate7 OctEconomic releaseInternational Trade in Goods and ServicesPeriodAugDate9 OctEconomic releaseInitial Jobless ClaimsPeriod4 OctDate15 OctEconomic releaseConsumer Price IndexPeriodSepDate16 OctEconomic releaseRetail SalesPeriodSepDate16 OctEconomic releaseProducer Price IndexPeriodSepDate16 OctEconomic releaseInitial Jobless ClaimsPeriod11 OctDate17 OctEconomic releaseHousing StartsPeriodSepDate23 OctEconomic releaseInitial Jobless ClaimsPeriod18 OctDate24 OctEconomic releaseNew Home SalesPeriodSepDate27 OctEconomic releaseDurable Goods OrdersPeriodSep PDate29 OctEconomic releaseAdvance Goods Trade BalancePeriodSepDate30 OctEconomic releaseGross Domestic ProductPeriod3Q ADate30 OctEconomic releaseInitial Jobless ClaimsPeriod25 OctDate31 OctEconomic releaseEmployment Cost IndexPeriod3QActivity delayed, not derailedUS government shutdown risk flares up more often lately, most recently six months ago when funding decisions were pushed to the brink but ultimately resolved at the last minute with a continuing resolution. Despite the frequent flare-ups, it’s been nearly seven years since the last government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019 during President Trump’s first term, which partially closed the government for 35 days. Despite being the longest government shutdown on record, a Congressional Budget Office study concluded that the economic impact was minimal; the authors estimate that the economy lost only 0.02% of projected GDP in 2019 directly related to the shutdown. Delayed paychecks initially slowed economic activity during the shutdown, but the disbursement of back wages when the government reopened spurred above-trend growth in subsequent quarters.The financial market impactThere have been many US government shutdowns over the years but few that lasted longer than a week. By definition, anything shorter than a week would have a negligible impact on the economy and therefore little impact on financial markets. We constructed three time series to measure the degree of volatility associated with shutdowns for the S\u0026P 500 and the 10-year Treasury note yield in instances when the shutdown was longer than a few days. The table shows the percentage change of the S\u0026P 500 and the 10-year Treasury yield leading up to the final date of budgetary authority and through the date that funding was restored. We focused on the weeks leading up to the shutdown because we believe media coverage over the possibility of a shutdown tends to influence investor behavior. Of those that have lasted longer than a week, we have seen mixed financial market results both heading into, and during, the shutdown (see Fig. 2).\n Fig. 2\nFinancial market moves ahead of and during past extended government shutdownsStart Date of Budget ImpasseStart Date of Budget ImpasseDate of Funding RestorationDate of Funding RestorationDuration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To ResolutionPercent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To ResolutionS\u0026P 500 IndexStart Date of Budget Impasse12/16/1995Date of Funding Restoration1/6/1996Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)21Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-0.2%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority1.5%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution-0.1%Start Date of Budget Impasse10/1/2013Date of Funding Restoration10/17/2013Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)16Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-1.2%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-0.9%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution1.2%Start Date of Budget Impasse12/22/2018Date of Funding Restoration1/25/2019Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)34Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-7.1%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-8.2%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution1.6%Start Date of Budget ImpasseDate of Funding RestorationDuration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary AuthorityPercent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution10-Year Treasury Note YieldStart Date of Budget Impasse12/16/1995Date of Funding Restoration1/6/1996Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)21Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority1%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority1%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution-1%Start Date of Budget Impasse10/1/2013Date of Funding Restoration10/17/2013Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)16Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-3%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-9%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution-4%Start Date of Budget Impasse12/22/2018Date of Funding Restoration1/25/2019Duration of Budgetary Statement (Number of Calendar Days)34Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-3%Percent Change from 2 Weeks Prior To The Final Date of Budgetary Authority-9%Percent Change from 1 Week Prior To 1 Day Prior To Resolution-5%The more significant adverse stock market reaction heading into the 2018 shutdown is notable, but it should be viewed in the context of investor worries over the imposition of import tariffs throughout 2018 and concerns over the impact of progressively tighter monetary policy. While it is possible that the equity market reaction to the 2018 shutdown could be repeated, we would note that the initial downtrend in December 2018 was temporary. By the time the stalemate was resolved in late January, the S\u0026P 500 index had rebounded.Banking on regulatory reform\n 11 Sep 2025  |  by Jeff Harwood, CFA, Equity Strategist, Financials, CIO Americas and Barry McAlinden, CFA, Fixed Income Strategist, CIO Americas\nThe substantial financial regulatory reform agenda under the current US administration is well underway, with a potential acceleration over the next six to 12 months.While bank capital reform will likely reduce capital requirements holistically, the revised standards will remain much stricter than pre-GFC levels and be more stringent than those in many other countries. We view these changes as a normalization of policy rather than a reversal.Revised capital requirements and easing of other regulatory rules provides greater clarity and flexibility for bank management teams. This should result in more productive redeployment and significant increases in balance sheet capacity.We see positive implications for both equity and fixed income investors as reforms normalize, driven by improved earnings power, resilient credit profiles, and favorable supply and demand dynamics for Agency MBS and bank corporate bonds as well as preferreds.IEEPA tariffs ruled unlawful on appeal\n 1 Sep 2025  |  by Kurt Reiman, Head of Fixed Income Americas\nCase likely to head to Supreme CourtOn Friday, 29 August, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a 7-4 ruling that upheld the lower Court of International Trade’s (CIT) May ruling that the US administration’s tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are unlawful. The IEEPA tariffs subject to this ruling form the bulk of the administration’s tariff wall and include:the overarching 10% baseline tariff,the fentanyl and border security tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China,the agreed-upon tariff rates with the UK, the EU, Japan, Vietnam, and others,the higher reciprocal tariffs levied on countries that run large bilateral goods trade surpluses with the US and were so far unable to reach a trade deal,the 40% additional tariffs on Brazil for its trial of the former president, andthe 25% additional tariffs on India for purchases of Russian oil.The appeals court allowed the IEEPA tariffs to remain in effect until 14 October to give the administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is highly likely to accept the case, but the timing of its decision is uncertain.Rebates applied specifically or broadly?The appellate (appeals) judges told the CIT to reconsider its decision to block tariffs across the entire US. The judges suggested that, instead, the court might limit its ruling to just the parties directly involved in the lawsuit. This advice comes after a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year in a case about birthright citizenship, which made it harder for federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions. Despite this, some lower courts have continued to block policies nationwide in similar cases.In the case of tariffs imposed by the government under the IEEPA, the appeals court pointed to the “major questions doctrine”—a legal principle that says if the government wants to make big policy changes with major economic or political impact, it needs permission from Congress. The Supreme Court previously used this doctrine to limit the Biden administration’s actions on student loan forgiveness and climate change.If the Supreme Court decides that the IEEPA tariffs are a matter of national importance and that the administration overstepped its legal authority, the impact would go beyond just the companies who sued. It could mean that all the tariffs collected under the IEEPA would have to be refunded by Customs and Border Protection, possibly with interest. This could cost the government hundreds of billions of dollars—money that was helping to reduce the federal deficit.Options to rebuild the tariff wallSectoral tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on aluminum, steel, copper, cars, and car parts are unaffected by the appeals court ruling. The administration has already introduced and even concluded a wide range of additional Section 232 investigations to determine whether imports of certain products cause harm to US national security interests. In the event the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings that the IEEPA tariffs are deemed unlawful, the administration could reconstruct some of its tariff wall with Section 232 tariffs on a wide range of products including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, aircraft, lumber, and more. For the baseline tariffs, the administration can employ Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs to address persistent balance-of-payment surpluses, but only up to 15% and for only 150 days without an act of Congress to extend them. Any longer-term tariff on countries running trade surpluses would have to come under Section 301, as was the case with China in 2018 and 2019, but only after the Commerce Department completes its investigation.US government shutdown risk increasedOvershadowed on a busy news day, the Office of Management and Budget directed “pocket rescissions” on Friday valued at nearly USD 5 billion of spending cuts, primarily on foreign aid. The move circumvents Congress, which is afforded the power of the purse, and directs that congressionally authorized payments not be made. Senators from both sides of the aisle condemned the move for sidestepping Congress, which was out of session for its summer recess. This worsens an already rancorous climate in Congress, which needs bipartisan support (60 votes in the Senate) to achieve the passage of all 12 appropriations bills before 30 September or a continuing resolution that would keep the government open but would extend the Biden budget baseline for the length of the continuing resolution. Odds of a government shutdown have increased as a result of this action.Investment implicationsBoth events are likely to have limited directional impact on financial markets in the near term but could stoke volatility as market participants attempt to determine the net effect. We won’t know the outcome for the IEEPA tariffs until the Supreme Court issues its ruling. The timing of this decision is uncertain but likely before 1Q26. If it declares the IEEPA tariffs unlawful, the return of collected duties to importers would help their earnings. However, there are numerous risks: a slightly worse fiscal position for the federal government; the actual headline risk for countries and sectors as the administration rebuilds its tariff wall; the fracturing of deals that involved investment pledges, improved market access, and purchase commitments; and the potential for retaliation given the administration’s more limited tariff authority.No tariff inflation? Not so fast\n 20 Aug 2025  |  by Kurt Reiman, Head of Fixed Income Americas\nAt a glanceWe expect the US effective tariff rate, now at over 18%, to settle near 15% by mid-2026, which corresponds to a 30-40% tariff range for China and 10-15% for other countries.The jump in tariffs and the corresponding fall in the value of the US dollar have yet to show up in a meaningful way in official inflation measures. The pass-through takes time, but the evidence that companies will pass this on to consumers is starting to accumulate.Although the effects of these tariffs have been slow to evolve, we estimate that tariffs will ultimately reduce GDP growth by around 1pp. Similarly, we expect the CPI to end around 1pp higher than it would be without the tariffs.The US effective tariff rate has risen to more than 18%, according to researchers at The Budget Lab at Yale University, yet the jump in tariffs has yet to show up in a meaningful way in official inflation measures. The pass-through takes time, but the evidence that companies will pass this on to consumers is starting to accumulate.I’m only just now beginning to see prices of imports begin to rise. Woodworking is one of my hobbies, and imported power tools are now more expensive. Festool, which I consider to be the Mercedes-Benz of power tools for its German engineering and design, announced that it would assess an “import fee” on 1 August. A look at an orbital sander on Festool's website, for example, suggests its price rose by 6% in early August. Why 6%? It’s possible this is the price increase that Festool needed to charge its customers to maintain its margins now that European manufactured products face a 15% tariff. If one assumes that shipping, warehousing, retailing, and other costs add 50-60% to the price of an imported power tool, then a 6% price increase would theoretically cover the cost of the tariff and protect margins.And so it begins. The long-dreaded goods inflation pressure is finally arriving at US shores and in stores. After several months wondering what the tariff rate will be, companies are passing it on to consumers. US International Trade Commission data show that customs duties collected at the border have been steadily rising since the start of the year as an increasing number of imported goods are now subject to tariffs (see Fig. 1). The higher tariff rates are also pushing the collected duty rate higher (see Fig. 2).Fig. 1: More imported goods subject to tariffs\n Imports, in bn of USD, and share of imports subject to tariffs, in %\n\n                Source: Bipartisan Policy Center, US ITC, UBS as of 17 August 2025\n            Fig. 2: Posted tariff rates start lifting the duties collected\n Monthly average US customs duty rate and effective tariff rate, in %\n\n                Source: Monthly Treasury Statements, US ITC, Bipartisan Policy Center, The Budget Lab, UBS as of 17 August 2025\n            But yes, this process takes time. Low-frequency purchases and premium products, like power tools, feed into CPI more slowly than high-frequency purchases, like bananas and coffee. Some imports were front-loaded to avoid tariffs. Fig. 1 offers evidence of an import spike in March 2025 when companies stocked inventories and consumers shopped ahead of the tariffs. And tariffs take a while to hit because shipping takes time. Goods shipped to the US after the administration imposed tariffs could take weeks or even months to reach store shelves.In addition to the effect of tariffs, exporters to the US also face a sharply weaker US dollar since the start of the year. Rather than appreciate in the face of higher tariffs as many anticipated, the US dollar has weakened 11% versus the euro, 6% versus the Japanese yen, and 7% versus the British pound (see Fig. 3).Fig. 3: Weaker US dollar versus major trading partners\n Exchange rate, index (January 2025 = 100)\n\n                Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve, UBS as of 19 August 2025\n            Some exporters routinely hedge their US dollar exposure, cushioning them from the impact of dollar depreciation, but such hedges would typically be in place for a year at most, so eventually their margins will take a hit unless they raise the prices in dollars that they charge importers. In turn, this would make it even more difficult for importers to absorb the tariffs they are paying. The theory espoused by Treasury Secretary Bessent and others in the administration, stating that consumers would not ultimately bear the cost of the tariffs, is implausible, in our view, unless the dollar strengthens.As we wrote in our Global Risk Radar report from 8 August, we expect the US effective tariff rate to settle near 15% by mid-2026, which corresponds to a 30-40% tariff range for China and 10-15% for other countries. Although the effects of these tariffs have been slow to evolve, we estimate that tariffs will ultimately reduce GDP growth by around 1pp. Similarly, we expect the CPI to end around 1pp higher than it would be without the tariffs.War in Ukraine – Alaska summit doesn’t result in immediate progress toward a ceasefire\n 17 Aug 2025\nThe meeting between US President Trump and Russian President Putin did not result in immediate progress toward a ceasefire in Ukraine. Follow-up meetings are being discussed, but it remains to be seen whether a framework for negotiations will emerge in the coming days. Trump highlighted that it was up to Zelenskiy to agree to a deal now.With the respective positions of Russia and Ukraine remaining far apart, no decisive developments on the battlefield, and continued support for Ukraine, we expect the war to continue into next year. Diplomatic efforts will likely continue, but we think any negotiation process will likely be drawn out given the lack of trust and distance between desired outcomes.Markets will likely turn their focus again toward the health of the global economy in light of raised US tariffs and the outlook for global interest rates. We recommend staying invested in well-diversified portfolios, including alternatives, to account for geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. We favor high grade credit and allocations to transformational innovation in the equities space.US tariffs: Implications for the Swiss economy\n 15 Aug 2025\nSwiss GDP growth significantly slowed in 2Q25 as US tariffs hit Swiss exports.Our GDP forecast for Switzerland assumes 15%US tariffs on Swiss goods (excluding gold and pharmaceuticals). If tariffs remain at 39%, we believe Swiss GDP growth could be reduced by up to 0.4 percentage points.While up to 0.4% of employment may be at risk if tariffs remain at 39%, the short-time work scheme should help cushion the impact on the labor market and limit the increase in unemployment, in our view.Tariffs gradually feeding into inflation\n 12 Aug 2025\nReleased today, the CPI for July rose 0.2% m/m, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.3%. The data was broadly in line with consensus expectations, and equity markets moved higher after the release.Looking at details of the report, falling energy prices (-1.1% m/m) helped to curtail the headline CPI, while airfares (+4%) and medical services (+0.8%) pushed the CPI higher. Core goods prices were up a relatively modest 0.2%m/m.As shown in the chart, it appears that the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices. In July, the effective tariff rate, based on customs duties actually collected, was around 9%. However, after the additional tariffs implemented last week, the statutory rates are around 18%, so the impact on importers' costs should rise further from here. We expect inflation to continue on a gradual upward trend as businesses pass along their higher costs, but slowing shelter inflation and push-back from increasingly stretched consumers should help offset some of the tariff impact. We expect core inflation to be around 3.5% at the end of the year, only modestly higher than the 3.1% reading in July.Despite the prospect of inflation moving further above the Fed's 2% target, we expect it to resume interest rate cuts at the next FOMC meeting on 16-17 September. Our base case calls for 25-basis-point cuts at each meeting through January for a total of 100 bps, which would bring policy to roughly a neutral setting.Core inflation starting to rise as tariffs feed through\n CPI and core CPI, year over year change in %\n\n                Source: Bloomberg, UBS as of 12 August 2025\n            Data integrity called into question\n 7 Aug 2025\nFollowing a weaker-than-expected jobs report last Friday, President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. This highly unusual move has raised questions over the future integrity of BLS data and government statistics in general.In our view, just as replacing Fed Chair Powell would not lead to an immediate change in Fed policy, replacing the head of the BLS will not suddenly lead to higher payroll numbers. With or without McEntarfer, we expect the BLS to make substantial downgrades to some of the historic payroll data when the annual benchmark revisions are announced on 9 September. Government statistics involve well established procedures, and we believe the agencies that produce them have a strong culture that would push back against any attempt to manipulate the data.Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that future data will be free from political influence. We already have an example of political influence in government data from the first Trump administration, namely the 2020 census. Among other things, the census determines the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives, which has obvious political ramifications. Just this morning, President Trump came out with a social media post saying that he wants undocumented immigrants to be excluded from the census for the first time.From the beginning of his term, the president has shown a strong preference to work with those who share in his line of thinking. Theoretically, if given enough time, it might be possible to change personnel and procedures in a way that could produce more favorable economic data. Near the top of the list of things that would cause us concern are the CPI data, which are also produced by the BLS. The CPI feeds into Social Security cost of living adjustments, changes to tax bracket income thresholds, payments on TIPS bonds, and a host of other areas with real-world consequences. Even the perception that the data is being altered for political reasons could be problematic.What Trump’s latest tariff threats mean\n 7 Aug 2025\nThought of the dayUS President Donald Trump stepped up his tariff threats yet again on Wednesday, doubling the tariff on Indian goods to 50% and targeting a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. While he said the semis levies would not apply to businesses that had made investments or a commitment to build and invest in the US, no further details about the plan were provided.The move came as the refreshed “reciprocal” tariffs on a wide range of trading partners came into effect after midnight today. Earlier this week, he said tariffs on semis and pharmaceuticals would be announced imminently, and that imported drugs could ultimately face a tariff rate of 250%.The market reaction so far has been relatively muted. S\u0026P 500 and Nasdaq futures are both 0.5% higher on Thursday before the US market open, extending the advance on Wednesday that pushed up the benchmark index by 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq by 1.2%.Pending final details, we have said the sector impact of semis and pharma tariffs appears manageable at this stage. Here we offer several perspectives for investors to consider as they navigate fresh trade headlines in the coming days and weeks.Tariff threats remain a pressure tactic rather than a sign of permanent escalation. Trump has demonstrated his escalate-to-de-escalate approach in negotiations, and we believe he has employed a similar strategy with the latest threats. The additional 25% tariff on India is set to take effect in 21 days, providing a window for further talks, with the next round of US-India negotiations scheduled for 25 August. We also think the Trump administration may be using the pharma tariff as leverage in its efforts to gain industry concessions on Most Favored Nation drug pricing. Additionally, the carveouts in these tariffs are not a coincidence—IT services in India (which has the largest revenue exposure to the US) are unscathed, generic drugs are exempt, and companies with commitments to investing in the US will not be charged with duties on semis. This shows that the Trump administration is aware of the potential economic impact of very aggressive tariffs.Tariffs are increasingly used to address issues other than trade imbalances, with geopolitical tensions coming into play. The Trump administration cited India’s ongoing purchase of Russian energy as the reason for the additional 25% duties, warning that China could also face new tariffs if it continues buying Russian oil as the White House steps up pressure on Moscow to end the war in Ukraine. Such penalties followed the politically motivated 50% tariff on Brazil as the US runs a trade surplus with the South American country. Geopolitical developments are fluid, and whether any truce could be agreed remains to be seen, but Trump’s use of tariffs highlights the intersection of trade and geopolitical risks.Fundamentals will remain the underlying driving force of markets. With markets becoming less sensitive to trade headlines, investors are taking more cues from economic data. While the impact of Trump’s tariffs has yet to be fully felt, recent data show that US companies are still increasing profits, consumer spending is holding up, and an imminent recession appears unlikely. With the Federal Reserve on track to resume easing in the coming months, fundamentals look set to keep markets supported.So, our base case remains that the US effective tariff rate will settle at around 15%—enough to weigh on growth and lift inflation, but not enough to derail the US economy or the equity rally. We expect near-term volatility to continue, but think investors should stick to their longer-term financial plan. In addition, to ensure portfolio diversification across asset classes, investors can consider capital preservation strategies for more defensive stock positioning, or prepare to buy the dips to build long-term exposure.Caught our attentionSwiss executive branch meets on US tariffs. Switzerland's executive body, the Swiss Federal Council, will convene an extraordinary meeting to discuss how to address the 39% tariffs that have come into effect on the nation's exports to the US. This follows the return of President Karin Keller-Sutter and Business Minister Guy Parmelin from Washington on Wednesday without an agreement to head off the levies, which are the highest in the developed world. The tariff, which is more than double the 15% negotiated by the European Union, threatens to place Switzerland at a competitive disadvantage in the US market. The Swiss economy could also be impacted if President Trump follows through on his pledge to impose additional tariffs on imports of all foreign pharmaceuticals coming into the US, since this accounts for the bulk of Switzerland's exports to the US. Despite the news, the Swiss benchmark stock index, the SMI, is trading 0.5% higher at the time of writing.Our view: While pharmaceuticals, which represent 60% of Swiss exports, remain exempt for now, the proposed 39% tariff threatens key sectors such as watches, machinery, and precision instruments. Although Switzerland has been working to address US concerns, the situation remains fluid, and prolonged disruptions could put Swiss companies at a significant competitive disadvantage. Our base case remains that Switzerland and the US will reach a tariff deal similar to the EU-US agreement, reducing levies to 15%. However, the outcome of the US's Section 232 tariff investigations and Trump’s efforts to lower pharmaceutical prices will be critical for foreign trade. We recommend investors focus on quality, high-dividend stocks, structured strategies, and phasing into balanced portfolios as ways to navigate and take advantage of trade-induced volatility.India: Oil and tariff conundrum\n 7 Aug 2025\nIndia has returned to the spotlight following a series of recent US tariff announcements, putting US-India trade relations under renewed scrutiny. Last week, US President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Indian exports after both sides failed to reach a trade deal by the 1 August deadline. On Wednesday, the US administration announced an additional 25% penalty on Indian exports, citing India’s ongoing purchase and “reselling” of Russian energy and military equipment, thus raising the total US tariff rate on Indian exports to the US to 50%.These developments mark a notable shift from earlier this year, when India appeared well-positioned to benefit from closer US ties, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China. The escalation in trade tensions has also raised concerns about India’s vulnerability to global factors and its status as a key beneficiary of multinational companies’ “China+1” strategy.”Oil remains India's Achilles' heelOil has long been viewed as India’s Achilles’ heel, given that it imports 88% of its total oil consumption to fuel the engines of growth for its 1.5 billion people economy. More recently, the share of Russian oil in its imports has risen from just 2% prior to 2022 to about 36% today. While lower oil prices in recent months have been a tailwind for India, any renewed spike would present a headwind for GDP growth and the current account. The latest US tariffs not only target Indian exports to the US but also specifically penalize India’s continued purchase of Russian energy, highlighting the intersection of trade and geopolitical risks.Maintain Attractive view on Indian equitiesTariff uncertainty could certainly dampen the foreign investors' sentiment as they adopt a wait-and-see approach. However, we do not believe these developments are material enough to change our Attractive view on Indian equities. Our constructive stance is supported by several structural and cyclical factors:First, we see the latest US tariff threats as a pressure tactic rather than a sign of permanent escalation. The new tariffs are set to take effect in 21 days, providing a window for further talks, with the next round of US-India negotiations scheduled for 25 August. While we do not expect India to budge on protecting its agriculture sector, it has scope for concessions to balance bilateral trade and address US concerns around its reliance on Russia. If India commits to increasing purchases of US energy and defense equipment, we believe this could help facilitate a deal. As a result, we think the current elevated US tariffs are unlikely to be permanent.Second, India’s goods export exposure to the US remains modest, accounting for only 2.2% of India’s GDP. Even if higher tariffs persist and goods exports to the US drop by 50%, the direct impact would be modest for an economy growing around 6.5% y/y. From an equity perspective, the Indian market’s high share of domestically-generated revenues makes it one of the most insulated equity markets in Asia. Less than 8% of index listed companies' revenues (MSCI India) are from the US, primarily from the service-oriented IT sector which remains unscathed. Still, these developments have introduced some short-term volatility into Indian equities; MSCI India is down 1.9% over the past 10 days, reflecting these realities.Finally, the key driver for the Indian equity market remains its strong earnings growth story, especially as the earnings downgrade cycle is nearing a bottom, setting the stage for a recovery in line with improving economic growth. Private consumption and government spending continue to support the economy and should drive earnings growth of 11.6% in FY26 and 14.1% in FY27. The upcoming 8th Pay Commission could provide an additional boost to consumption. Importantly, the Indian equity market is increasingly driven by robust domestic flows, underpinned by high household savings and a strong retail investment culture. This shift has also made the market less dependent on foreign flows and more resilient to global volatility.Therefore, we maintain our \"Attractive\" view on Indian equities and believe any dips would offer an opportunity to increase exposure.Limited exposure to US market\n MSCI India's sector revenue exposure, by domestic and US revenue share (in %)\n\n                Source: Factset, UBS, as of August 2025\n            Currency markets: Tariff uncertainty is here to stay\n 5 Aug 2025\nThe USD has recently gained ground against both G10 and EM currencies, amid better-than-expected US macro data—at least on the surface.We remain concerned about slower US growth in 2H, potential Fed rate cuts, persistent twin deficits, and the politicization of Fed policy. Hence, we reiterate our guidance of further USD weakness.EUR, NOK, and AUD remain our top picks in G10. In EM, we continue to favor elevated carry in currencies like the MXN, as US tariff risks peak and volatility remains subdued.US tariffs on Swiss exports: No immediate pressure for SNB rate cuts\n 4 Aug 2025\nThe SNB is expected to keep its policy rate at 0%, intervening in foreign exchange markets only if temporary appreciation pressures on the franc emerge.The economic impact of the tariffs should be limited, as key sectors like pharmaceuticals and gold are exempt and our base case assumes lower final tariffs; even if tariffs remain high, we believe a negative policy rate would mainly affect the exchange rate and offer little broader support.About 60% of Swiss exports to the US—up to 10%of total exports—are affected by tariffs, not enough to justify aggressive monetary easing, especially given ongoing USD weakness.The recent announcement of a 39% US tariff on Swiss exports to the United States, effective 7 August 2025, could weigh on Switzerland’s growth and inflation outlook if not swiftly reversed. Intuitively, this weaker outlook should put downward pressure on the Swiss franc. However, the franc’s perception as a safe haven and ongoing global uncertainty have limited its depreciation since the announcement.At this stage, we are not revising our forecast for the Swiss National Bank (SNB) policy rate. We continue to expect the SNB to keep its policy rate at 0% over our forecast horizon, with only occasional interventions in the foreign exchange market if temporary appreciation pressures on the Swiss franc arise.Our forecast is based on several factors:Tariff impact likely to be limited: Our base case assumes the final tariffs will be lower than currently announced, reducing their negative impact on Swiss growth and inflation. Even if tariffs remain high, the main risk is a temporary dip in growth—potentially two quarters of negative GDP growth, or a technical recession—but not a broader economic downturn, in our view.Limited effectiveness of rate cuts: The SNB has little room to offset tariff effects through monetary policy. A rate cut would push the policy rate into negative territory, but negative rates mainly influence the exchange rate. Past experience shows that while negative rates can ease appreciation pressure, they do not generally lead to sustained franc depreciation.US dollar dynamics: Since the tariffs target Swiss exports to the US, the USDCHF exchange rate is key. Our purchasing power parity model suggests the USD is not undervalued against the franc, and the dollar is already on a depreciation path due to loose US fiscal policy, expected Fed rate cuts, and global investor diversification out of the USD. The SNB has limited ability to counteract these broader trends.Tariff scope is partial: Pharmaceutical and gold exports appear exempt from the new tariffs. Conservative estimates (based on US data for 2024) suggest around 60% of Swiss exports to the US will be affected by the 39% tariff, representing up to 10% of total Swiss exports. Therefore, introducing a negative policy rate to offset tariffs on only a portion of exports would be disproportionate, in our view.Looking ahead, there is a risk that sector-specific tariffs could be extended, particularly to pharmaceuticals, which would further increase downside risks to Swiss growth. Any inflation impact would likely emerge in 2026 if Swiss unemployment rises, potentially slowing down private consumption and wage growth. However, a negative policy rate would likely do little to support economic growth beyond its effect on the exchange rate.The euro remains weak against the franc according to our purchasing power parity model, but as long as appreciation pressures are contained, we believe that there is no compelling case for the SNB to introduce a negative policy rate at this stage. That said, a move into negative territory remains a risk scenario if global economic growth slows more than anticipated and triggers more extensive monetary easing in the US and Eurozone, increasing appreciation pressure on the franc.No deal, but trade talks likely to continue\n 1 Aug 2025\nSwitzerland was unable to reach a trade agreement with the US. It now faces tariffs of 39%starting 7 August.Our base case remains that Switzerland and the US will reach a tariff deal similar to the agreement between the EU and the US with 15% tariffs. Given Switzerland’s exposure to pharmaceutical exports, the outcome of \"Section 232\" tariff investigations and Donald Trump's efforts to lower the prices of pharmaceutical products play an equally important role for foreign trade.In our base case, we expect weak growth but no recession for the Swiss economy in the coming quarters. Meanwhile, the SNB is likely to keep its policy rate at 0%.Switzerland was unable to reach a trade agreement with the US before the deadline on 1 August, President of the Swiss Confederation Karin Keller-Sutter announced via social media. On Thursday evening, the US government published a new list of tariff rates that will apply from 7 August. Tariffs on US imports from Switzerland will be raised to 39%. The proposed tariff rate on “Liberation Day” in April was 31%, and 10% during the subsequent “reciprocal” tariff pause.The lack of result from negotiations comes as a surprise. There were several indications over recent weeks that Switzerland and the US were closing in on a deal. According to press reports, the Swiss and US delegations already agreed a memorandum of understanding several weeks ago. However, President Keller-Sutter also mentioned that the high US trade deficit with Switzerland (in goods) stood in the way of a final agreement.The pattern of previous negotiations in US trade disputes suggests that the failure does not mean a breakdown in talks, but rather marks the start of another round of discussions. However, the pressure on Switzerland has increased. In our base case, we still expect the US and Switzerland to ultimately reach a trade deal. We believe it is likely to be similar to the US-EU agreement: a tariff rate of 15% on US imports from Switzerland and a commitment for Swiss companies to make significant investments in the US.Such an agreement would significantly reduce the tariff burden for companies compared to the currently announced 39% and reduce uncertainty. However, a tariff rate of 15 %still represents a significant increase in levies compared to before \"Liberation Day.\" To make matters worse for Swiss exporters, the US dollar has depreciated significantly against the Swiss franc since the beginning of the year.A key issue for Switzerland is the levies on its pharmaceutical products. These account for around 60%of Swiss goods exports to the US. A spokesperson for the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs said Swiss authorities understand that the tariffs will not apply to the pharmaceuticals sector, as reported by Reuters. However, two other factors are important with respect to pharmaceutical exports: industry-level tariffs, which are based on the outcome of Section 232 investigations, and President Trump's efforts to lower the prices of pharmaceutical products. While the issue of US pharma imports makes the situation for Switzerland more complicated, it may also create some leeway for a deal.The US is an important trading partner for Switzerland and accounted for around 19% of all Swiss goods exports in 2024. A trade agreement comparable to that with the EU would significantly impact Swiss exports to the US, but would be manageable, in our view.If Swiss exports to the US are to be subject to import tariffs of almost 40% for a prolonged period, the economic damage would be much greater. This is especially true because Swiss exporters would also face a competitive disadvantage compared to EU exporters.Global economic development is crucialNonetheless, over 80% of total Swiss exports do not go to the US. For this reason, it is important to consider how US trade policy affects the global and especially the European economy.The US currently levies 15% on EU exports. This burdens export-oriented sectors in the Eurozone, but the large German fiscal package should help to cushion some of the negative impact in the medium term. We expect Eurozone growth of 0.7% over 2025, but there is a risk of a more pronounced economic slowdown.In a scenario with weak but not negative growth in the Eurozone, we expect the Swiss economy to expand by around 1% this year and the next. Foreign trade is likely to weigh on growth, but the economy will continue to be supported by domestic demand. Given the possibility of a stronger slowdown in the Eurozone and higher-than-expected US tariffs, there is also a risk for Switzerland that growth will be weaker than previously forecast.If Switzerland fails to reach a trade agreement with the US similar to the one with the EU, the downside risks are significantly greater.SNB likely to keep policy rate at 0%The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is likely to keep its policy rate at 0% over the next 12 months, in our view. Growth in the second half of the year will probably be weak, but should a tariff deal be reached, the outlook remains resilient enough not to warrant a negative policy rate. With a stable SNB policy rate, a sideways trend in long-term interest rates is also likely. However, negative interest rates cannot be ruled out, especially if Switzerland fails to secure a trade deal with the US.We expect EURCHF to remain close to current levels, with a 12-month forecast of 0.94. Next year, fiscal policy in Germany could still contribute to a recovery in the European economy and support the euro. In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to complete its rate-cutting cycle soon. That said, persistent high economic and political uncertainty tends to benefit the Swiss franc. Overall, this points to a sideways trend on a spot basis.The dollar is likely to continue to weaken against the Swiss franc, with our 12-month USDCHF forecast at 0.76. We expect a cooling of the US economy and more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which should reduce the attractiveness of the dollar. In addition, the Trump administration’s erratic policies are likely to have caused longer-term damage to the US dollar’s status as a reserve currency. However, the dollar has already priced in some of these negative developments with its sharp decline in recent months, which limits the downside potential.Swiss equity marketListed Swiss companies are truly global, generating some 90% of sales and profits outside of Switzerland, one-third of which in the US. Over the past 10-20 years, they have made large efforts to become more local in every market, and thus be less reliant on imports and exports. This has, however, not been possible in every industry or every company for efficiency and marketing reason. Of the US sales, an estimated two-thirds are locally produced, with the remaining third partially imported from Switzerland. Note that majority part of these imports from Switzerland are pharmaceutical products that remain exempt from new US tariffs at this stage. In sum, the direct impact on the overall Swiss equity market from the newly announced US tariffs will be negative, but not destructive, in our view.Certain parts of the market may be affected more significantly, including watch and machinery manufacturers as well as parts of medtech. Moreover, smaller companies tend to be more reliant on exports and are thus more at risk. We recommend investors focus on quality firms and services companies, including those in the telecommunication, health care, and consumer staples sectors, as well as select mid-caps and cyclicals. Our favored investment theme is attractively valued high-yield equities with dividend growth.Risk case: 39% tariffs here to stayIn a risk case scenario, the US and Switzerland cannot find an agreement in the foreseeable future and Swiss companies would have to contend with tariffs of nearly 40%, while European peers—often key competitors for the US export market—would only face tariffs of 15%. In such a scenario, we think the pressure on Swiss stocks would be more pronounced. The SNB would likely lower the policy rate further to cushion the tariff shock and might aim for a higher EURCHF exchange rate. Growth would decline significantly in this scenario, but lower interest rates and a potentially slightly weaker frank might be sufficient to avoid a recession.US drug pricing: MFN Letters sent to Pharmaceutical Companies\n 1 Aug 2025\nOn 30 July the Trump administration released letters sent by President Trump to 17 pharmaceutical company CEOs. The letters demanded the companies engage in “good faith” efforts to comply with the President’s 12 May executive order (EO) to institute Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing in the US. MFN would bring certain US drug prices down to the lowest level available among a group of developed nations. In general, the US has higher prices for branded pharmaceutical products than most other OECD nations. The letters released yesterday make the following demands:Pharmaceutic prices on marketed products for Medicaid recipients are reduced consistent with MFNMFN prices apply for all future new product launches for all US payer channels (Medicaid, Medicare, Commercial/Employer, and Individual/Cash Pay)Any revenue from future increased prices outside the US to be repatriated to the US and used to reduce prices for US consumersEstablishment of direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution systems for US consumer access (presumably for cash paying/uninsured patients)The Trump administration’s demands outlined in these letters largely repeat the provisions in its 12 May EO. Nevertheless, the letter also established a 60-day window for these pharmaceutical companies to engage in a “good faith” process to meet the President’s demands, with a commitment that the administration will deploy “all tools at its disposal” to achieve its MFN goals if the pharmaceutical companies do not comply with President Trump’s demands.While the tone of these letters can be described as imposing, and even threatening, we continue to believe that without legislation establishing MFN as law, the administration has limited tools with which to impose MFN. We also believe some of the added MFN details expressed in these letters point to the administration’s limited MFN tools and potentially a rather narrow application of MFN if imposed along the lines outlined in these letters. Nevertheless, the letters lack important details, making the potential implementation of MFN hard to assess at this stage.We note that in the first demand the administration limits the application of MFN on existing drugs to the Medicaid channel and excludes the much larger Medicare and Commercial/Employer channels. The US Medicaid program already receives large pricing rebates on pharmaceutical products, typically much larger than discounts and rebates in the bigger Medicare and Commercial channels. We estimate that the imposition of MFN within Medicaid only would have a manageable financial impact on the pharmaceutical industry, likely below 5% of global operating income. Obviously, without details, any estimate has wide error bars, but limiting MFN to the Medicaid program suggests that the administration may recognize its limited ability to impose MFN broadly and/or that there may have already been some conversations with certain companies about MFN within Medicaid.On the administration’s second demand, we believe pharmaceutical companies are already considering higher drug launch pricing outside the US to avoid having to lower launch prices in the US. If companies did set higher prices outside the US, non-US government payers would likely limit access to newer higher priced drugs. But we believe the higher price/lower volume OUS trade-off would likely have negligible financial impact. In short, we believe the pharmaceutical industry could live with this provision.The third demand implicitly recognizes a likely MFN response from the pharmaceutical industry, as it would raise prices outside the US more than it would lower US prices. The Trump administration wants these companies to agree that any raised prices outside the US would translate into lower prices in the US and not translate into windfall profits. We view this merely as a recognition by the administration that MFN might well have unintended consequences which might not result in the desired goal—lower US drug prices. We don’t view the lack of any windfall profits from higher OUS prices as a meaningful negative for the industry.We view the last demand—DTC pricing channels—as largely irrelevant and designed to reduce the profit stream generated by various “middlemen,” such as PBMs. While bashing PBMs has been a favorite talking point of both the pharmaceutical industry and certain politicians, we note that the big three PBMs (CVS, CI, and UNH, controlling 80%-plus PBM market share) have combined PBM operating profits equal to roughly 3% of global pharmaceutical industry sales. We therefore believe depriving PBMs of their profits would have minimal impact on drug pricing. We also believe DTC distribution would mainly affect the cash-pay/uninsured segment of the market, which is relatively small.Stepping back, we do not think the demands outlined in these letters would have a significantly negative impact on these companies or the broader pharmaceutical industry, assuming these demands would apply to all pharmaceutical companies at some point. We believe that the first demand—MFN for Medicaid—is the most relevant and that it would have a manageable impact, likely less than 5% of industry operating income. Nonetheless, we note these demands lack detail, and as with most policy, details matter. In particular, the definition of Medicaid and whether it would include patients eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare (dual eligibles) is an important missing detail.In terms of sentiment, the Trump administration’s letters set an imposing and even threatening tone. We do not recall prior examples of similar communication from a Presidential administration to particular companies or an industry. And it certainly appears that the pharmaceutical industry has a target on its back, as it faces both an MFN EO and sector tariffs. We believe those policy risks are keeping investors away from pharmaceutical equities, and we acknowledge the near-term uncertainty will likely linger at least until late September, when the administration’s 60-day window expires. We also believe pharmaceutical industry tariffs could well be linked to MFN drug pricing, as the administration may view the tariff threat as a negotiating tool with the pharmaceutical industry.At the same time, we try to look through these current overhangs and into the likely future operating environment for the pharmaceutical industry. Taking the MFN demands outlined in the administration’s letters at face value, we believe the impact on the pharmaceutical industry would be manageable, mainly because of the apparent limitation to the Medicaid channel. Clarity on these demands should improve investor sentiment by reducing uncertainty. In the near term, however, we acknowledge the heightened uncertainty from these letters and expect investor sentiment on the pharmaceutical sector to remain subdued.Trump unveils new tariffs\n 1 Aug 2025\nThought of the dayUS President Donald Trump announced a wave of new tariffs as the 1 August deadline arrived, including a 35% duty on many goods from Canada, 50% for Brazil, 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan, and 39% for Switzerland. 69 trading partners were listed in the executive order Trump signed late on Thursday, facing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%. Goods from all other countries not included would be subject to a 10% tariff. Mexico, meanwhile, received a 90-day extension for further negotiation.The new rates will take effect after midnight on 7 August to allow time for US Customs and Border Protection to prepare. Separately, judges from a federal appeals court showed skepticism over the president’s authority to impose sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) during a hearing on Thursday. The court is not expected to make a ruling until a later date.Although the 1 August deadline was well telegraphed, the initial market reaction to the tariff announcement was negative. At the time of writing, S\u0026P 500 futures are trading 1% lower. While the Swiss stock market is closed for the 1 August National Day, European markets opened lower. Asian markets came under pressure with declines in the Indian and Taiwanese benchmarks in particular.But our base case remains that the US effective tariff rate should settle at around 15% by the end of the year, and the economic impact is likely to prove manageable.The global minimum rate appears better than previously feared, with recent deals underscoring reduced trade risks. The global minimum tariff rate, at 10%, has turned out to be lower than markets anticipated, as Trump previously floated the notion of a 15-20% rate for countries that do not negotiate separate deals with the US. The flurry of deals that were reached over the past 10 days, especially those with major trading partners like the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, have also solidified market confidence that the worst of the trade conflict has passed and that the Trump administration would want to avoid tariffs that could cause serious damage to the US economy.The headline “reciprocal” rates may exaggerate their actual impact, and there is more room for negotiation. While Trump levied a 35% tariff on Canada, the majority of Canadian exports to the US will be exempted due to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Similarly, a long list of Brazilian products is exempt from the 50% tariff, while exports to the US only account for less than 2% of the South American country’s GDP. We believe there is room for further talks that could bring the “reciprocal” tariffs lower for some markets. The US negotiation team is scheduled to visit India later this month, while Taiwan said a trade deal with the US is close. Given Trump’s escalate-to-de-escalate negotiating approach, we expect more trade agreements to emerge in the coming weeks and months. The 90-day extension for Mexico and a possible similar arrangement with mainland China support this view. Additionally, a US official told reporters that more deals are in the works.The shift in copper tariffs points to challenges in bringing manufacturing back to the US. Trump pushed ahead with the 50% tariff on copper imports, but this week exempted refined copper from the levies. This, in our view, highlights the administration’s acknowledgment that it would take time to bring some sectors back to the US. We have said that sectoral tariffs could prove to be more durable as they’re levied on more solid legal grounds, but the latest development and the provision of a grace period for pharmaceutical imports suggest that these taxes may not be as punitive as Trump had previously threatened.Still, these tariffs would be a headwind for global trade and growth, and they have started to contribute to a rise in inflation. With markets already pricing in much of the good news on the trade front, we expect stock volatility to pick up in the near term. Investors should consider ways to navigate market swings ahead, including structured strategies and buying on dips depending on their equity allocation relative to long-term benchmarks.Caught our attentionUS and Switzerland fail to reach a trade deal. Switzerland was unable to reach a trade agreement with the US before the 1 August deadline, according to a social media announcement from Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. The US government subsequently published a new list of tariff rates, raising levies on Swiss imports to 39% starting 7 August. This is a sharp increase from the 31% rate announced on “Liberation Day,” well above the 10% rate applicable during the recent tariff pause, and would be the fourth-highest US trade levy if further negotiation efforts fail. In a separate statement on 1 August, a spokesperson for the Swiss Federal Department of Economic Affairs said Swiss authorities understand that the tariffs should not include the pharmaceuticals sector, as reported by Reuters. The Swiss government said it is assessing the situation and remains in contact with US authorities, aiming for a negotiated solution.Our view: The US is Switzerland’s largest export market, accounting for about 19% of Swiss goods exports in 2024, or CHF 52.7 billion. The failure to reach a deal means Swiss exporters risk facing a 39% tariff, compared to just 15% for the EU. This puts Swiss companies at a significant competitive disadvantage, especially in export-oriented sectors like watches, machinery, and precision instruments. While pharmaceuticals—making up around 60% of Swiss exports to the US—are currently exempt, the situation remains fluid and subject to further US policy changes. Our base case remains that Switzerland and the US will reach a tariff deal similar to the agreement between the EU and the US with 15% tariffs. Given Switzerland’s exposure to pharmaceutical exports, the outcome of \"Section 232\" tariff investigations and Donald Trump's efforts to lower the prices of pharmaceutical products play an equally important role for foreign trade.US inflation rises to the highest level in four months. The headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% in June, following an upwardly revised 0.2% gain in May, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.6%, up from 2.4% previously and still above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. Core PCE, which excludes food and energy, also increased 0.3% on the month, matching May’s pace, and pushed the annual rate to 2.8%. These figures were broadly in line with expectations and reflect the gradual pass-through of tariffs to consumer prices. Meanwhile, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, rose 0.3% in June after being flat in May, supporting a rebound in second-quarter GDP growth.Our view: While the June PCE data confirm that tariffs are beginning to lift inflation, we continue to expect the US effective tariff rate to settle near 15%, resulting in only a modest increase in overall price levels. The process of passing on higher import costs to consumers is likely to be gradual, and we expect this trend of moderate tariff-driven price increases to persist in the months ahead. Any above-expectation surprises in inflation could complicate the Fed’s ability to justify rate cuts; however, core services inflation remains subdued, and shelter inflation, which is a key driver of overall price growth, is expected to continue slowing. Additionally, while GDP growth rebounded in the second quarter, underlying data point to moderating activity such as a sharp slowdown in business and residential investment, in line with our base case of US GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% in 2025 from 2.8% last year. Combined with a softer labor market, these factors should allow the central bank to begin easing policy later this year.Resilient gold demand. The World Gold Council data for the second quarter of 2025 showed that the key drivers of demand for the precious metal remain intact. Central bank buying did slow from a four-quarter average of 206 metric tons (mt), but was still a decent 166.5 mt. Another key demand driver—investor appetite for gold exchange traded funds (ETFs)—grew, with inflows of 170.5 mt up from a four-quarter average of 83 mt. Bars and coins contributed 307 mt of demand compared to a 299 mt four-quarter average. Gold prices rose 6.9% during the second quarter of this year, from USD 3,123/oz to USD 3,303/oz.Our view: We do not see central bank demand for gold collapsing at this stage, and the slight slowdown in the second quarter appeared to be due more to certain central banks normalizing buying after a few quarters of very aggressive purchases. Various surveys have indicated that central banks shifting their allocation from USD to gold should continue for some time. We continue to maintain that investors should optimally be allocating a mid-single-digit percentage of their portfolios to gold as a diversifier against geopolitical risk, and we see gold prices at USD 3,500/oz through the first half of 2026.Asia tariff deals reaching the finish line\n 1 Aug 2025\nAsia trade deals emergingRecent deals in Asia fall into a pattern: Large-scale purchases of US goods and investment in exchange for headline tariffs generally lower than \"Liberation Day\" proposals. While final details have yet to emerge, it is looking more confident that the overall Asia tariff rate should end up in a 15-20% range. Three general tiers are emerging: A low tariff rate of 10-15% for advanced Asia/OECD economies, which may include closer security allies; a high rate of 30%+ for China and Vietnam (where there is evidence of transshipment); and a mid-level rate of around 20-30% for others.South Korea ended up with a deal based on a similar template as Japan’s. Both have a headline tariff rate of 15%, including the auto sector, but must invest heavily in the US (USD 350bn for Korea versus USD 550bn for Japan). For Korea, this puts its effective tariff at around 15%, allowing for section 232 tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum products. If product tariffs were to be imposed at a 25% rate in full on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products, the effective rate would rise to the high teens, which is closer to our earlier thinking. Meanwhile, Taiwan was handed a 20% reciprocal tariff—slightly higher than the rest of North Asia—but the effective rate will be substantially lower than its peers due to significant tech sector product exemptions. Key to watch will be how high and broadly applied the section 232 tariffs on semiconductors will be. These could raise Taiwan’s overall tariff rate back up to mid-teens.India has been eager to reach a deal, but the process has been longer given the political difficulty of removing too much trade protection in the agricultural sector. In the longer run, we see scope for the 26% \"Liberation Day\" proposed tariff to be reduced towards 20%, but to achieve this, greater purchases of US energy and equipment are likely to be included. We see this as a longer journey, and extensions along the way are likely. In any event, the GDP impact is minor, as it is for Indonesia and the Philippines given the low contribution of trade to economic growth in these economies. We do not see real GDP slowing by more than 50bp this year due to tariffs.ASEAN, aside from Singapore, is solidly in the mid-tier tariff category. Tariffs on the Philippines and Indonesia were set at 19% earlier in exchange for full market access, which marks a sizable drop from Liberation Day levels for Indonesia. Meanwhile, Thailand and Malaysia also settled at a lower-than-previously threatened 19%, which comes as somewhat of a relief given the transshipment risk. For the bloc, pending semiconductor product tariffs are set to raise the effective tariff on Malaysia while pharma sector tariffs could hurt Singapore. But overall, we still see ASEAN ending up with 15-20% effective levels while Singapore remains in the lower 10-15% tier with other advanced economies. In the end, the more trade driven economies of Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand face a larger slowdown in real GDP growth of around 2%, mostly in 2H versus last year.It must be remembered that the tariff \"game\" is playing out on various levels. Current exemptions are reducing the headline rates, but upcoming section 232 product tariffs (pharmaceuticals, semiconductor and copper) will raise the overall burden. By how much depends largely on the rate and breadth of implementation. The end result, in our view, is Asia ex-China ends up with average effective tariffs at the high end of a 15-20% range.We expect our base case outcome to present a headwind to US growth rather than induce a recession. Asia economic growth would still suffer from a mild export contraction in 2H, but should avoid a protracted GDP slowdown below 4%.Sector product tariffs pending on chips and pharma\n Percentage of a market's exports to US\n\n                Source: CEIC, UBS\n            Asia \"transshipment\" risks vs. \"friend-shoring\"\n % share\n\n                Source: CEIC, UBS\n            India to face 25% tariffs and penalties on US exports\n 31 Jul 2025\nEffective 1 August, India exports to the US would face a 25% tariff along with a penalty. We do not expect this to be a final decision and remain hopeful of an eventual trade deal.Ahead of the US negotiation team’s visit to India in August, US President Donald Trump escalated trade tensions on Wednesday by announcing a 25% tariff on Indian imports effective 1 August, along with an unspecified “penalty” for India’s continued purchases of Russian energy and military equipment.In our view, despite this escalation, India should generally be relatively insulated from tariff wars, given that US merchandise exports to the US constitute about 2% of gross domestic product (GDP). If these 25% tariffs remain, but the penalty is ultimately dropped, we expect a limited impact on India's GDP—15bps in FY26 and 25bps in FY27.Nevertheless, this markedly higher rate of tariffs versus competing economies could impact India’s strategic positioning within ‘China +1’ strategies, and could affect India’s attractiveness in global supply-chain shifts. Further, while Nifty and MSCI India earnings are minimally exposed to exporters, the second-order impact from US tariffs on Indian exports would likely be spread across multiple sectors in the economy with varying intensity.Sector-wise, we think textiles and garments, gems and jewelry, chemicals, industrial goods components, auto components, and electronics could see the most direct impact. According to media reports, pharmaceuticals will see a separate carve-out, but risks on those names may continue until we see the final announcement of US tariffs on pharmaceutical products. IT services should not see any direct impact given that services are not part of the proposed tariffs. Oil refiners could be negatively impacted, due to the potential crude oil sourcing shift from Russia, which may impact refinery profitability, though the price gap between Russian and global oil has already narrowed, suggesting that the impact could be manageable.Overall, we maintain our preference for domestic-oriented sectors like financials and consumption, as they have the potential to benefit from supportive monetary and fiscal policies. At the proposed 25% tariff rate (excluding penalties), India's GDP growth in both years would still exceed 6%, and we think the Reserve Bank of India could likely step up support if needed. Importantly, we do not view the announced tariffs and penalties as final, at this stage. Given the US trade delegation's expected visit to India in August, we remain hopeful of an eventual trade deal and that some of the above impact could get reversed.Brazil: Between trade schisms and solid fundamentals\n 30 Jul 2025\nOn 30 July, US President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order implementing an additional 40% tariff on Brazil, bringing the total tariff amount to 50%. A long list of products is exempt from these higher tariffs. This move marks an escalation in bilateral tensions. Notably, the US administration’s rationale extended beyond traditional economic justifications, referencing Brazil’s domestic political affairs.The US Trade Representative (USTR) launched a Section 301 investigation into Brazil’s trade practices. The probe will assess whether Brazil’s actions on digital trade, tariffs, anti-corruption, intellectual property, ethanol access, and deforestation unfairly discriminate against or restrict US commerce.The situation remains fluid. Former President Bolsonaro has received a legal notice and is now required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet. Subsequently, the US government canceled visas for 8 out of the 11 Brazilian Supreme Court judges and imposed sanctions on Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes.Meanwhile, Brazil’s economic performance remains resilient. Economists have recently revised 2025 GDP growth forecasts upward to 2.25%, inflation expectations are moderating to 5%, unemployment is at a historic low of 6%, and the central bank is preparing to ease monetary policy in the coming months. The Brazilian real (BRL) has appreciated around 10% this year against the US dollar, even after the most recent tensions with the US.The international dispute may get worse before it gets better, depending on Brazil’s response as the US proceeds with the threatened tariffs. Also, the Brazilian Supreme Court may rule against former President Bolsonaro in the coming weeks.We expect greater clarity on the bilateral relationship by year-end. The US will likely have finalized several agreements with other countries that could serve as models for a deal with Brazil, and businesses affected by tariffs will continue to press for solutions to minimize losses for all parties. Today’s announced tariff exemptions appear to be a reflection of this reality.Investor attention will eventually return to economic data, the central bank cycle, and next year’s general elections. While we anticipate short-term volatility due to challenging US-Brazil negotiations, we think stability should return by year-end with limited economic impact.We maintain a positive outlook on Brazilian equities and believe the BRL will remain one of the resilient emerging market currencies, supported by its 15%positive carry and continued US dollar weakness.Copper tariffs coming down to the wire\n 25 Jul 2025\nPresident Trump could very well make good on his early-July threat to impose a universal 50% tariff on all copper imports beginning 1 August, especially if aluminum and steel tariffs serve as a blueprint.Despite the tariffs, the US should remain a net copper importer over the medium term with smelting capacity the main bottleneck, while appetite for investment in new capacity is low at current levels of US mine production.Outside the US, we see global supply challenges remaining supportive of copper prices as mine supply growth is limited. As a result, the market should be undersupplied in the years ahead.Several questions remain over the implementation of these tariffs and if they extend to all products. However, if the tariffs stick, we expect domestic copper prices to rise further. With few substitutes, US manufacturers are well prepared to pass on any incremental costs to consumers.\n 25 Jul 2025\nInvestors have been waiting for inflationary signs from US trade. Federal Reserve Chair Powell seems to have personally seen price increases already, informing President Trump that trade taxes were one reason for the Fed’s rising building costs. US buyers of consumer appliances—washing machines, dishwashers, and the like—are also bearing the brunt of the April trade tax increases.Consumers in Europe, the UK, Mexico, and Canada are paying between 0.3% and 1.9% less for the consumer appliances they buy than was the case in March of this year. The US consumer, meanwhile, is paying (on average) 3.6% more for their appliances than they were before Trump’s trade taxes.Appliance exporters to the US have shown no inclination to offset (or “pay”) the trade taxes with lower export prices. In fact, US import prices for appliances (before tariffs are added) have risen a little since March. Domestic producers have also been raising prices—perhaps reflecting higher component costs, but perhaps also reflecting a preference for profit over market share.The headline numbers will take time to reflect the full effect of trade taxes. But looking at detailed data where taxes are being imposed, it seems clear that the burden falls on the US consumer, not the exporter.Trump’s Japan deal points to improving trade clarity\n 23 Jul 2025\nThought of the dayUS President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he has reached separate trade agreements with Japan and the Philippines, following deals with Indonesia and Vietnam earlier this month. Asian equities reacted positively on Wednesday, with the Nikkei 225 rallying over 3.5% amid gains across the region. S\u0026P 500 futures rose 0.3% ahead of the US market open.The deal with Japan appears to be better than market expectations. Instead of the previously threatened 25%, the tariff on imports from Japan will be set at 15%, including autos, which account for around 30% of Japan’s exports to the US and are the largest component of the US trade deficit with the country. The deal would also see Japan invest USD 550bn in the US, as well as make additional purchases of agricultural goods.The agreement with the Philippines set a 19% rate, the same level as Indonesia agreed and just below Vietnam’s 20% baseline level. Separately, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he will meet his Chinese counterpart in Stockholm next week for their third round of talks, while Trump told reporters that the US is “getting along with China very well.”The latest developments are in line with our view that greater clarity on the administration’s trade policy should take shape in the coming months. We see several factors for investors to consider as they navigate the markets from here.The Trump administration remains keen to reach deals with trading partners despite stocks being at all-time highs. The rebound in equities since the post-“Liberation Day” low may have emboldened Trump to maximize his pressure tactics to increase his leverage in bilateral negotiations by sending out trade letters threatening higher trade levies. But the better-than-expected outcome with Japan suggests that the administration remains wary of the economic impact if a no-deal scenario leads to retaliatory actions from trading partners. For example, the European Commission is preparing countermeasures against US services as well as goods, according to media reports. We maintain the view that the US administration will not want tariffs so high that they choke off trade, fuel inflation, or push the economy into recession.The legality of “reciprocal” tariffs remains in question, while details on sectoral tariffs have yet to come. The trade agreements Trump has announced so far are more of a handshake deal rather than a comprehensive, binding pact that would normally take one to three years to reach. Our view is that “reciprocal” tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are likely to be declared illegal by the US Supreme Court later this year or early next year. But the tariff wall can be rebuilt through other routes, including sectoral tariffs on national security grounds based on Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. While sectoral tariffs could be more durable, they take longer to be implemented. The lower tariffs on Japanese autos and the provision of a grace period for pharmaceutical imports could also suggest that these levies may not be as punitive as Trump had previously threatened.The most likely scenario, in our view, remains that the US effective tariff rate ends the year at around 15%. While this represents a sixfold increase over tariff levels in 2024, such a rate is well below what was threatened in the immediate aftermath of “Liberation Day.” These tariffs will likely have a negative impact on US growth and will boost US inflation, but we believe the US economy should avoid a recession as aggregate household balance sheets remain strong. An uptick in market volatility, however, remains likely as fresh headlines emerge. A larger-than-expected impact showing up in economic data could also dampen investor sentiment, where optimism has prevailed so far.So, we see further equity gains over the next 12 months but think investors should consider ways to manage potential volatility in the near term, including structured investments and phasing-in strategies. Investors can also build longer-term exposure to our Transformational Innovation Opportunities of Artificial intelligence, Power and resources, and Longevity.For Japan, the lower tariffs on autos could translate into a 0.4-percentage-point improvement in the country’s real GDP growth this year and again in 2026. The deal also removes a key downside risk for the Japanese yen, and we reiterate our view that USDJPY should trend lower over the medium term, especially since we expect the Federal Reserve to resume policy easing later this year. In the near term, we expect USDJPY volatility until there is clarity over Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s future, and we favor selling USDJPY on rallies as well as selling the upside price risk for yield pickup. Among Japanese equities, we favor additional exposure to oversold and high-quality cyclical stocks in the auto, machinery, and health care sectors, as we believe they offer appealing medium-term returns.Caught our attentionPresident Trump floats further tax cuts. The US president said on Tuesday that his administration was considering eliminating taxes on capital gains from home sales. \"If the Fed would lower the rates, we wouldn't even have to do that,\" he said. \"But we are thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.\" The suggestion comes after the approval earlier in July of President Trump's flagship tax and spending bill, which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated will add more than USD 4 trillion to US government debt over the coming decade. Worries over rising US debt caused a spike in US Treasury yields in May, though sentiment later stabilized. Markets have also been unsettled by concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve, following repeated criticism of Fed Chair Powell by President Trump, who has argued that policy rates should be lowered.Our view: Our view is that markets have already priced in higher deficits and that US debt remains sustainable. We expect the yield on the 10-year US Treasury to decline to around 4% by the end of the year, from 4.37% at the time of writing, as the Fed resumes easing over the coming months. We expect the funding of the deficit will likely come through increased short-end supply, especially Treasury bills. The 30-year yield has declined the least after rising more than other points on the curve as Trump's fiscal package made its way through Congress. This is indicative of long-end yields being most sensitive to debt sustainability concerns. We favor high-quality investment grade bonds in the intermediate area of the yield curve as they offer attractive risk-return profiles and allow investors to lock in yields at historically attractive levels.CIO Alert: Trump tests market optimism over trade\n 13 Jul 2025\nWhat happened?US President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, capping a week in which he went back on the offensive in negotiations with trade partners.In a social media post, the President described his nation’s trade deficit as a risk to national security. The escalation in trade tensions comes after last week’s expiration of a 90-day pause on most of the “Liberation Day” tariffs announced by the White House on 2 April. There was a steady stream of trade threats through the week, starting with the delivery of a batch of letters to 14 nations announcing that higher tariffs would be introduced on 1 August unless further concessions were made. The administration also indicated it would implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, along with duties of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals entering the US.The more aggressive stance on tariffs has so far failed to shake investor optimism. The S\u0026P 500 struck an all-time high late in the week, and even after a 0.3% decline on Friday, the index is up 25.7% from its low for the year on 8 April, when concerns over trade were most intense. This sanguine reaction contrasts with the 12% fall in US stocks in the week following President’s “Liberation Day” address on 2 April, in which he outlined a series of “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners that run goods trade surpluses with the US.What do we expect?Despite the noise, we believe the most likely scenario remains that the US effective tariff rate ends the year at around 15%. IEEPA tariffs will likely be declared illegal by the Supreme Court, but not until later this year or early next year. The President’s capricious use of IEEPA in the past week, using it to justify tariffs on Brazil, further bolsters our view. The tariff wall can be rebuilt through other routes, such as country and product tariffs, but would be much more limited in scope.So how do the latest events fit with this view? The resilience of US economic data and stocks rising to fresh highs appear to have emboldened President Trump to maximize his pressure tactics to increase his leverage in bilateral trade negotiations. Taken together, the current proposed tariffs would lift the US effective tariff rate close to or even above 2 April levels.If the administration were to implement the aforementioned tariffs on 1 August and leave them at those levels, the likelihood of a US profits and economic recession would increase. Treasury Secretary Bessent understands the importance of not lifting tariffs to a level that would risk harming economic activity, particularly since the deficit-to-GDP ratio will remain around 7% over the next few years following the passage of the OBBB. The unnamed “official” who claims that Canada and Mexico tariffs will receive USMCA exemption is a sign the administration is at least aware of the potential damage.We therefore believe that the administration is using this latest round of tariff escalation to maximize its negotiating leverage and that it will ultimately deescalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and stock market volatility.With respect to the European Union (EU), our base case remains that the two sides will likely reach an agreement before 1 August, or the administration will extend the deadline again while negotiations are ongoing. However, the US president’s seemingly maximalist and aggressive demands—including “complete, open market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to us”—make it difficult to predict the EU’s response. There is now a non-negligible risk that trade tensions between the EU and the US escalate, which would be damaging for both economies.On our estimates, European economic growth in the second half of the year could easily turn negative as weaker external demand and further declines in business confidence, investment, and hiring weigh on activity. In this scenario, as per the ECB’s June forecasts, we would expect the central bank to ease rates by more than currently anticipated, potentially approaching 1% in the coming months. For more on this, read our blog, President Trump threatens 30% tariff on EU imports.Turning to Mexico, in his letter threatening the 30% tariffs, President Trump acknowledged Mexico’s recent progress on border security but stressed that more action is needed against drug cartels and existing trade barriers. Our view is that all three areas are moving in the right direction.We do not expect Mexico to retaliate in a disruptive way and although details are still emerging, it appears the 30% tariff would apply only to a small share of trade that is not compliant with the USMCA trade pact. This suggests the risk of a major trade conflict is low. The upcoming review of the USMCA agreement is becoming increasingly relevant. We expect the agreement to remain in place, even if negotiations bring greater US demands. For more on this, read our blog, Mexico: Tariff shock mitigated by USMCA.How do we invest?The Trump administration looks likely to persist with its confrontational negotiating tactics, which could lead to renewed market swings. It is also possible that the White House will only back away from its latest threats if the market falls. We have been advising investors to take steps to bolster the resilience of their portfolios against this uncertain backdrop. This includes the following:Phasing into equities: In our view, any further rise in the S\u0026P 500 this year is likely to be limited before greater policy clarity and renewed Fed easing help push the market higher in 2026. One way to manage near-term risks is to phase into equities, building exposure gradually and taking advantage of pockets of volatility. US technology, health care, and financials; select Asian tech sectors (Taiwan, India, mainland China); and quality or thematic plays in Europe all offer attractive growth prospects. Early allocation allows investors to capitalize on these trends as they unfold.Consider strategies to mitigate policy risks: These can include an allocation to gold, which has proven to be a reliable hedge against policy uncertainty over recent years. We believe a midsingle-digit percentage allocation to gold in a USD portfolio can diversify and hedge against political risk and inflation. A modest allocation to select hedge funds can enhance portfolio resilience, take advantage of volatility, and smooth overall return outcomes. Finally, any renewed market swings can be used to lock in gains and make portfolios more defensive with capital preservation strategies.Focus on long-term opportunities: Innovation remains a key driver of long-term equity performance and an important feature of enduring market leaders. Structural shifts in AI, energy infrastructure, and health care are expanding global profit pools and reshaping industries. We expect our TRIO themes—AI, power and resources, and longevity—to offer durable, secular growth that we believe can persist well beyond short-term market volatility.Reduce excess dollar exposure: The USD’s traditional role as a perceived “safe haven” is being called into question. Investors have already begun reassessing excess exposure to USD assets amid increasingly unpredictable US policymaking. Further near-term uncertainty is likely to give support to perceived safe haven currencies and commodities like the CHF (and to some degree the JPY) versus the USD. The euro has been the main currency for many to express concerns around the resilience of the US economy and the US dollar. Although it is hard to judge the short-term market reaction, the prospects of lower US growth and the Fed having room to cut US interest rates favor a weaker USD. We therefore like to make use of any EURUSD pullback to position for an exchange rate move to 1.20 or higher over the coming quarters.President Trump threatens 30% tariff on EU imports\n 13 Jul 2025\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 30% tariff on EU imports into the US from 1 August, alongside a similar announcement affecting Mexico. This announcement comes as the latest in a series of letters from the president as the pause on “Liberation Day” tariffs expired. Moreover, it is higher than the original tariff rate announced in April of 20%.At this stage, it is unclear whether this is another “escalate to negotiate” tactic by the president, or if these tariffs will actually be implemented. Discussions between the EU and the US have been ongoing for several weeks. While little is known about the likely outcome, sentiment had recently improved, with indications that the EU was preparing to accept an agreement similar to that reached with the UK, where a 10% tariff would apply to most goods, with tariff quotas for certain sectors. This latest intervention from the president may prompt the EU to refocus its efforts and prepare for retaliatory measures if an agreement cannot be reached.Our base case remains that an agreement will likely be reached before 1 August or that the deadline is extended again while negotiations are ongoing. This would probably result in a deal where the US imposes tariffs on EU exports at around 10%. Certain sectors, such as autos, steel, aluminum, and copper, would attract higher tariffs. For now, key sectors such as pharmaceuticals are expected to remain exempt, but may face tariffs in due course. In our view, this outcome would dampen activity in export-related sectors and weigh on business confidence, keeping growth subdued in the coming months. However, an expansionary fiscal package from Germany, together with modestly looser fiscal policy in other parts of the bloc, should help offset some of the negative impact from global trade. In addition, already low interest rates in the Euro area, a robust labor market, and high levels of precautionary savings should support domestic demand. Under this scenario, we expect full-year growth to come in a little above 1%, and the ECB to cut interest rates once more this year, most likely at the September meeting.If, however, the 30% tariffs are imposed on 1 August and, crucially, are sustained, the economic outlook will become more challenging, with a recession likely. The US president’s seemingly maximalist and aggressive demands—including “complete, open market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to us,” and the threat that “whatever the number you choose to raise (countermeasures) by, will be added on to the 30% that we charge”—make it difficult to predict the EU’s response. There is now a non-negligible risk that trade tensions between the EU and the US escalate, which would be damaging for both economies. At the time of writing, Polymarket (a predictions market) points to slightly less than a 50% chance of an agreement being reached. On our estimates, growth in the second half of the year could easily turn negative as weaker external demand and further declines in business confidence, investment, and hiring weigh on the European economy. In this scenario, as per the ECB’s June forecasts, we would expect the central bank to ease rates by more than currently anticipated, potentially approaching 1% in the coming months.For investors, the weekend’s announcements are likely to result in further volatility in the weeks ahead. Maintaining diversification remains key. Periods of volatility should be seen as opportunities to phase into equities and long-term structural themes such as AI, power and resources, and longevity, particularly for those under-exposed to these areas. With cash rates still likely to fall, and potentially falling faster under the scenario of tariff escalation, in the coming months, seeking more durable sources of income in higher-quality investment grade bonds and diversified bond portfolios should also be considered. We prefer tenors of four to five years in USD bonds and four to seven years in EUR, GBP, and CHF.Specifically for European equities, we believe the direct impact of US-EU tariffs are manageable, with most of the 25% of European revenues that are generated in the US comprised of unaffected services or goods produced locally. Of the 5-10% of European corporate revenues that could be affected, a large portion will also be pharmaceuticals, which are not affected by this specific escalation. So we expect only a low-single-digit percent impact to earnings from the direct effects. However, the indirect impact via a weaker global economy is more a risk given the cyclical nature of European equities. This uncertainty can weigh on European equities in the short term, but we believe investors may quickly look through any concerns of a man-made slowdown, so we recommend using pullbacks as opportunities to phase into high-quality European stocks, beneficiaries of the positive policy developments in Europe via our “Six ways to invest in Europe” theme, and transformational opportunities that can support the European industrials and IT sectors.Turning to currencies, further near-term uncertainty is likely to give support to perceived safe haven currencies and commodities such as the CHF (so to some degree the JPY) and gold versus the USD. The euro has been the main currency for many to express concerns around the resilience of the US economy and the US dollar. Although it is hard to judge the short-term market reaction, the prospects of lower US growth and the Fed having room to cut US interest rates favor a weaker USD. We therefore like to make use of any EURUSD pullback to position for an exchange rate move to 1.20 or higher over the coming quarters.Mexico: Tariff shock mitigated by USMCA\n 13 Jul 2025\nUS President Donald Trump has announced a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico, effective 1 August. Mexican exports that comply with the USMCA trade agreement will remain exempt from these tariffs, according to Bloomberg. If so, we think this significantly limits the impact of this latest tariff threat, as roughly 90% of Mexican exports to the US are either USMCA-compliant or already covered by sector-specific agreements, such as autos and auto parts.Recently, the US administration has zeroed in on three main areas in its relationship with Mexico: migration, drug trafficking, and trade.In his letter threatening the 30% tariffs, President Trump acknowledged Mexico’s recent progress on border security but stressed that more action is needed against drug cartels. He also called for further progress on existing trade barriers.Our view is that all three areas are moving in the right direction. While periodic tensions are likely, leaders from both countries are incentivized to keep making joint progress and to maintain a constructive relationship.1. Migration: Clear progressHere, the improvement is tangible. Unauthorized border crossings at the US-Mexico border have dropped sharply over the past year (Fig. 1), reflecting stronger enforcement and better bilateral coordination. As long as this cooperation continues, we expect migration-related tensions to remain manageable.\n Fig. 1\nSteep fall in unauthorized border crossingsSouthwest land border encounters\n                Source: CBP, UBS, as of May 2025\n            2. Organized crime: Positive momentumDrug trafficking—especially fentanyl—remains a top concern for the US administration, as highlighted in President Trump’s letter. He criticized Mexico for not doing enough to curb cartel activity.However, increased pressure from Washington appears to be driving a shift in Mexico’s security strategy. President Sheinbaum has moved away from the previous “hugs, not bullets” approach. Under Security Minister García Harfuch, the government is now prioritizing intelligence, investigations, and cross-border cooperation to disrupt organized crime and its financial networks (see Investing in Mexico: Security: Evergreen challenge, glimmer of hope).While these early steps are encouraging, the challenge is complex and progress will take time. Still, Mexico’s renewed focus should allow it to offer “concessions” to help ease US concerns.3. Trade: Constructive engagementCrucially, media reports indicate that White House officials have clarified that USMCA-compliant exports will remain exempt from US tariffs. In our view, this significantly limits the impact of the latest tariff threat, as roughly 90% of Mexican exports to the US are either USMCA-compliant or already covered by sector-specific agreements, such as autos and auto parts.Although details are still emerging, it appears that for now, the 30% tariff would apply only to a small share of trade outside USMCA rules of origin.We do not expect Mexico to retaliate in a disruptive way. Authorities are likely to continue engaging constructively with the US to safeguard preferential market access and avoid escalating tensions ahead of the upcoming USMCA review. Mexico's Foreign Minister Ebrard has confirmed that permanent binational working groups are in place to lead negotiations.Focus on USMCA reviewWhile the tariff announcement on 12 July raises concerns, USMCA-related exemptions suggest that the risk of a major trade conflict is low. The upcoming review of the USMCA agreement is becoming increasingly relevant. We expect the agreement to remain in place, even if negotiations bring greater US demands in areas such as labor standards, energy policy, transshipment, and security cooperation.Investment implicationsThe Mexican peso and local equities may see short-term volatility but should remain resilient given the narrow scope of the tariff threat and incentives for continued cooperation. Mexican USD sovereign bonds continue to offer attractive carry over US Treasuries, with credit risk remaining manageable, in our view. We maintain a constructive outlook on Mexican corporate debt in USD, supported by strong fundamentals and appealing yields.President Trump threatens Brazil with 50% tariff\n 10 Jul 2025\nUS President Donald Trump has announced a 50% tariff on goods made in Brazil, with effect from 1 August, justifying the decision on both trade and non-economic grounds. Trump’s letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says that all goods will be subject to tariffs, without exception. It also claims that Brazil’s ongoing trial against former President Jair Bolsonaro “should not be taking place. It is a Witch Hunt”.Lula responded to the letter, saying that “any unilateral move to raise tariffs will be met in accordance with Brazil’s Economic Reciprocity Law.”Negative, yet manageable economic impactIf the 50% tariff rate remained in place, it would present a negative shock to the Brazilian economy, but one that would be modest in size, in our view.Brazil remains a relatively closed economy, with exports and imports amounting to just 28% of GDP in 2024. In addition, China is by far the country’s largest trading partner. Brazil exported goods worth USD 40 billion to the US in 2024, 16% of overall exports, and less than 2% of GDP. The diversification of Brazil’s export basket also acts as a buffer.However, the US's 50% tariff would impact more strongly certain products, such as semi-manufactured iron and steel (72.5% of exports are destined for the US), aircraft (63.2%), construction materials (57.5%), ethanol (48.5%), and wood and related products (43.2%).A relevant transmission channel for Brazil’s economy is monetary policy. The Brazilian real (BRL) has stood out this year for its strength, appreciating by over 13% against the US dollar before the tariff announcement. Should schisms with the US persist, and investor sentiment toward Brazil could cool down, and we think a weaker BRL would constrain the ability of Brazil's central bank (Banco Central do Brasil; BCB) to cut interest rates, thereby tightening financial conditions in the country.Unclear tariff pathTrump’s threatened 50% levy on Brazil looks like a new variant in the use of tariffs for non-economic reasons.It is not clear on what grounds the US administration would implement this tariff. If it were to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the sake of speed, as it has with many of the bilateral tariffs this year, it would have to declare a national emergency as it did with the non-economic tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking and immigration. As the US runs a goods trade surplus—not a deficit—with Brazil, we think it would be hard to justify the use of IEEPA tariffs in this case to alleviate the US's persistent trade deficit. Sections 232 and 301 are available to the US president, but would require an initial investigation and would have to be based on a trade-related grievance.Given the possible legal hurdles, we think the 50% threatened tariff on Brazil looks unlikely to become permanent.As for Brazil, due to likely contained economic downside given the country’s relatively weak trade links with the US, we believe the Lula administration may not immediately change its position, unless there is strong pressure from local exporters. Therefore, the standoff may not de-escalate rapidly, in our view.Investment implicationsWe remain constructive on Brazilian assets. We reiterate our Attractive view on Brazil stocks. Although they may experience short-term volatility, we expect the direct impact on economic activity and corporate earnings to be contained. Other drivers of our call, including the prospects of a weaker US dollar, ongoing interest in geographic diversification by global investors, improving corporate ROEs, and the prospect of central bank rate cuts, are still in place.As for the BRL, we think that after an initial bout of volatility, it is likely to strengthen against the US dollar from current levels into the year-end.We will continue to reassess our views based on the evolution of the tariff situation, investor confidence, and foreign direct investment and portfolio flow patterns.\n Fig. 1\nBrazil exports, by geographyAs a % of total Brazil 2024 exports\n                Source: UBS, Bloomberg, as of July 2025\n            Trump’s tariff letters do not signal trade war escalation\n 8 Jul 2025\nFrom the studioPodcast: Tune into our latest Across the Pond episode for insights on global AI investment opportunities beyond the US with CIO equity strategist Sundeep Gantori.Video: Chief economist Paul Donovan: CIO read through on the OBBBA (12:06)Video:CIO mid-year checklist– key portfolio steps with Jon Gordon (5:50)Video:CIO mid-year checklist – equity moves with Crystal Zhao (4:41)Video:CIO mid-year checklist – credit strategies with Timothy Tay (3:04)Thought of the dayUS President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled the first batch of letters that threaten new “reciprocal” tariffs on the nation’s trading partners, charging 25% levies on imports from Japan and South Korea, and 25-40% on goods from another 12 countries including smaller Asian economies and South Africa. Trump warned that any retaliatory tariffs will trigger like-for-like US tariffs on top of the threatened rate. The S\u0026P 500 fell the most in three weeks, and the US dollar rose. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more letters will be sent out in the coming days.However, Trump also signed an executive order on Monday extending the pause of the “reciprocal” tariffs to 1 August, allowing more time for trade negotiations. He added that the new deadline was “not 100% firm” and that the US remains open to further talks with countries offering additional concessions. Investor sentiment stabilized on Tuesday ahead of the US market open, with both Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi posting gains, and S\u0026P 500 futures flat. Asian currencies have also clawed back early losses.We continue to expect various sector-specific tariffs to follow, including levies targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, lumber, and critical minerals, and there remains significant uncertainty over the scope and shape of these Section 232 tariffs. Market volatility is likely to pick up, but the latest development does not constitute an escalation in the trade war, in our view.The letters have been well publicized, and the tariffs remain around the same levels announced in April. The renewed threat that \"reciprocal\" tariffs could again rise higher toward the 2 April levels suggests that far fewer bilateral agreements are materializing than the Trump administration had hoped for at this stage. So far, the White House has signed just three handshake deals, well short of prior suggestions that 90 deals could be completed in 90 days. The fact that new sectoral tariffs might be imposed on countries even after an agreement is reached is likely part of the reason negotiations remain challenging. Given Trump’s escalate-to-de-escalate negotiating approach, the US administration may be looking to gain additional leverage in talks with these latest numbers. However, the move did not come as a surprise, with Trump reiterating his intention multiple times in the past several weeks. The new tariff rates are also similar to the levels announced in early April, suggesting that the administration’s purpose is not to re-escalate trade tensions.More deals are likely to emerge amid ongoing negotiations. With Trump leaving the door open for additional negotiations and a new deadline, we continue to expect country-specific deals and arrangements in the coming weeks. These could include a baseline tariff and selective quotas or exemptions from sectoral tariffs in exchange for purchase commitments or US investment pledges. It is worth noting that the impact of “reciprocal” tariffs can be less than the announced headline rate after taking the carveouts into consideration. Additionally, notable trading partners like the EU and India did not receive a letter this round, suggesting that some deals could be in the making. Reuters reported that the EU is close to an agreement with the US that may include concessions on aircraft, medical equipment, and alcohol, while Trump indicated he US could soon make a deal with India. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said over the weekend that several deals are close.The economic costs will rise if tariffs stay elevated for a longer period. While the US administration may choose to pursue elevated tariffs for more leverage, a prolonged period of higher levies would likely increase economic costs and could bring political consequences for both Trump and the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections next year. With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) estimated to add USD 4.1tr to the US deficit over the next decade, we think trade policies or threats that risk a recession will ultimately be negotiated lower. Tariff revenues are needed to help offset spending provisions in the OBBBA, but excessively high tariffs could reduce trade, growth, and tax revenues.So, while tariffs will likely remain high—compared with levels at the start of the year—as will the headline risk, we think the US effective tariff rate should end the year at around 15%. This would be a headwind to growth but not enough to trigger a recession given the resilience of the US consumer and the adaptability of global supply chains. We continue to recommend phasing into global equities or diversified portfolios to navigate volatility ahead.Who could win and lose on tighter Trump AI controls\n 7 Jul 2025\nFrom the studioPodcast: Jump Start: Tariff deadline, the Big Beautiful Bill, and US labor resilience (4:57)Video: Chief economist Paul Donovan: OBBBA winners and losers (12:06)Video:CIO mid-year checklist– key portfolio steps with Jon Gordon (5:50)Video:CIO mid-year checklist – equity moves with Crystal Zhao (4:41)Video:CIO mid-year checklist – credit strategies with Timothy Tay (3:04)Thought of the dayThe Trump administration is preparing new restrictions on AI chip exports to Malaysia and Thailand, according to Bloomberg, with the aim of preventing advanced processors from reaching China via third countries. The draft Commerce Department rule would target shipments from companies like NVIDIA, following concerns over semiconductor smuggling, as well as Chinese access to AI compute capacity based in Southeast Asia. Malaysia has quietly emerged as a key AI data center hub, accounting for nearly 12% of NVIDIA's global sales last quarter. NVIDIA's exposure to Thailand is less clear.The US administration reportedly plans to introduce these new controls with the rollback of the more stringent “AI diffusion” export curb system introduced under the previous administration. If it goes through, this would mark the first major round of AI regulation under the new Trump administration since it scrapped the Biden-era rules. A similar proposal, the AI Diffusion Act, was introduced in January 2025 but later rescinded.Without taking any single-name views, we make several observations for global investors with AI exposure:New regulations, on the heels of the June rally, could trigger volatility. While the proposal appears relatively modest, we believe additional restrictions on AI chip exports could act still as a near-term overhang for cyclical tech stocks. Regulatory signals leading up to this have been relatively accommodative, with the White House reining in the Biden-era tiered AI diffusion rules. The recent rally in global tech was driven more by price-to-earnings multiple expansion than by positive earnings revisions, which suggests less room for any misses in second-quarter results. The upcoming earnings season also means the market is now in its peak blackout period for share buybacks, where companies are unable to step in and support share prices in the event of any declines.US hyperscalers, data center operators could be shielded. The proposal reportedly includes a key concession: American data center operators will still be allowed to import US AI chips. This suggests major US hyperscalers, such as Google and Microsoft, can continue their regional data center expansions without significant disruption. We believe Malaysian companies primarily serving US-backed projects should remain relatively insulated from the new export restrictions. In contrast, data center operators building facilities speculatively or targeting Chinese demand may be more exposed to order cancelations or project delays.We think AI capex demand, outlook remains solid. Our analysis shows that AI compute, including GPUs and custom AI chips, has attracted the strongest capital investment so far in 2025. This is reflected in robust spending commitments from the Big 4, sovereign buyers (including those in the Middle East), neoclouds, but also likely some China-linked demand. That said, the early April ban on H20 AI chip exports to China has already done much of the heavy lifting. We expect AI compute’s share of total AI capex to rise from approximately 53% in 2024 to about 59% in 2025. As investment broadens into areas like high-bandwidth memory, networking, and industrial AI infrastructure, we anticipate AI compute’s share will later normalize toward 50-55% from 2026 onward.Against a backdrop of new potential chip restrictions and a broadening out of AI trends, we recommend investors adopt a balanced portfolio stance within tech and the AI value chain. Recently, we shifted our preferences away from some of the cyclical AI-linked stocks that rallied in June, tilting instead toward select AI laggards as well as internet and software stocks. Amid heightened volatility, we think investors may also want to consider structured strategies to help navigate market swings. Beyond near-term risks, we believe the robust secular trends in AI will continue to drive long-term gains in the tech sector. Data center stocks in Southeast Asia may be more sensitive in the near term to headline risk and potential policy changes. Within Chinese equities, we believe the impact on large-cap tech shares should be manageable.Republicans pass the OBBBErratum: An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated that the House Republications approved the OBBB on Wednesday morning. This has been corrected to Thursday afternoon.House Republicans approved the Senate's version of the One Big, Beautiful, Bill on Thursday afternoon, ushering in an era of steep spending cuts and reforms alongside even larger cuts to individual and corporate taxes, many of them permanent.Deficits as a share of GDP will likely remain around 7% over the next decade, substantially higher than CBO estimated in January.Financial markets have largely anticipated this move. The economic impact is directionally positive for equities, but the fiscal concerns are likely negative for the US dollar.Razor-thin margin of approvalOn 3 July, a slim majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted to approve the Senate’s version of the One Big, Beautiful, Bill (OBBB), President Trump’s signature economic policy agenda. Republicans’ gamble with the one-bill strategy ultimately paid off, although at several junctures the legislation appeared to be on thin ice. Leaders of both the Senate and the House could afford only three defections, but despite strong objections by a handful of senators and members of the House Freedom Caucus over spending cuts either being too large or not large enough to contain the deficit impact, the legislation advanced enough of the party’s core agenda to cross the finish line. This approval paves the way for an official 4 July presidential signing ceremony.Large spending cuts, larger tax cutsThe bill includes permanent extensions to a range of individual and corporate tax rates from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), adds new temporary tax exemptions for tips, overtime and for people over age 65, earmarks higher spending on border security and defense, as well as reforms to Medicaid, nutrition, clean/renewable energy, and student loan assistance programs (see Fig. 1). While the bill adds trillions to the US debt load over the next decade, the bill also lifts the debt limit by USD 5 trillion, helping to avoid a fiscal showdown later this summer when the Treasury projected that its general account would be depleted.\n Fig. 1\nDecade estimates of the OBBB cost and savingsMajor components, in USD billions10-year costs10-year costs10-year costsExtend TCJA individual \u0026 estate tax provisions3,36910-year costsRestore TCJA business and international tax provisions97710-year costsNew individual tax provisions42010-year costsExpand TCJA individual \u0026 estate provisions38110-year costsDefense spending15310-year costsHomeland security/immigration spending15010-year costs10-year costs10-year savings10-year costsMedicaid and healthcare1,07410-year costsRepeal or modify energy and clean vehicle tax credits69910-year costsStudent loans35010-year costsFood assistance programs28510-year costsExpand and modify TCJA business and international tax10310-year costsOther tax provisions (CBO and JCT)24In our 2024 ElectionWatch coverage, we noted the high likelihood that deficits would rise under a unified government. Congressional Budget Office estimates from January 2025 projected a decline in the deficit-to-GDP ratio from 6.4% in 2024 to 5.2% in 2027. According to the Yale Budget Lab estimates, the deficit-to-GDP ratio is now poised to remain around 7.0% through the next decade (see Fig. 2). The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the bill will add USD 4.1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, including interest, and USD 5.5 trillion if all of the tax cut provisions are made permanent.\n Fig. 2\nOBBB yields sustained high budget deficitsDeficit-to-GDP ratio under various scenarios, in %, 2024-2034\n                Source: The Budget Lab, UBS as of 1 July 2025\n            Current policy baselineSenate Republicans departed from the usual convention of scoring the reconciliation bill based on the current law baseline and instead opted to use the current policy as its baseline for measuring the bill’s impact on the deficit over a 10-year window. One of the Byrd Rule provisions prevents reconciliation from expanding the deficit over a 10-year window. By assuming current policy as the baseline, the over $3 trillion in individual income tax extensions didn’t technically add to the deficit projections. This move likely erodes legislative fiscal restraint if it sets a new precedent for future unified governments, which seems likely.Investment implicationsWhile the bill details were only finalized this week, investors have known the general contours and magnitude of the tax and spending cuts since the House initially passed a similar version of the bill at the end of May. Consequently, the markets have, in our estimation, largely priced in the economic implications of the bill. This includes a modestly positive fiscal impulse in 2026, although we expect this to be offset by other policy changes. Thereafter, spending cuts beginning in 2027 reduce the fiscal impact, assuming that they are actually implemented. In addition, the larger projected deficits will result in increased Treasury issuance, a development also well understood by investors.This economic impact is directionally positive for equities, in our view, and has contributed to the rally over the last three months, but as a distant secondary factor.In fixed income, Treasury yields have declined over the past month even as the larger-than-expected future Treasury supply became apparent. We expect the funding of the deficit will likely come through increased short-end supply, especially Treasury bills. The 30-year yield has declined the least after rising more than other points on the curve. This is indicative of long-end yields being most sensitive to debt sustainability concerns.Finally, sustained deficits as a share of GDP near 7% are a factor in the likely continued depreciation of the US dollar.Markets await more trade news after US-Vietnam deal\n 3 Jul 2025\nFrom the studioPodcast: Investors Club: CIO's Carl Berrisford on Chinese robotics momentum (11:53)Video: CIO mid-year checklist – your next equity moves with Crystal Zhao (4:41)Video: CIO mid-year checklist – credit strategies for the second half with Timothy Tay (3:04)Thought of the dayUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the US had reached a trade agreement with Vietnam. The deal, which stemmed from direct talks with Vietnamese General Secretary Tô Lâm, is said to impose a 20% tariff on Vietnamese exports to the US, and a higher 40% levy on goods deemed to be transshipped through the country. Trump said that Vietnam had agreed to drop all levies on US imports in return.Vietnam's state media on Thursday said President Trump has been invited for a state visit to Vietnam, and that tariffs on several Vietnamese products would be significantly cut. No formal trade text has been publicly released, and it’s not clear how the transshipment provision (aimed largely at products rerouting from China) would be implemented and enforced. In early April, Trump had imposed a 46% duty on Vietnam as part of his initial rollout of the “reciprocal” tariffs, before pausing at a 10% level for negotiations.The benchmark Vietnamese equity index fell 0.2% on Thursday, and regional markets in Asia were mixed. While we await more concrete details, we make several initial observations for global investors:Tariff stakes are now higher for economies with elevated US surpluses, transshipments. The draft Vietnam deal confirms that countries with sustained high trade surpluses with the US, and those acting as transshipment hubs for Chinese goods, may face higher baseline tariffs and additional duties on rerouted products. It also confirms a broader US effort to ring-fence and curb perceived Chinese overproduction and excess capacity. In April, we warned of higher risks to Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand over transshipments. It’s difficult to calculate accurately and estimates vary, but Nomura data suggest nearly 19% of Vietnam’s US goods exports reflect Chinese value added, with Malaysia and Thailand next in line at 11.5%and 9.8%, respectively. We anticipate the economic pain will be far more significant for Vietnam than China, given this represents a minimal fraction of China’s overall exports. Still, heavier penalties for transshippers should further accelerate supply chain shifts out of China, as US companies still need to source products competitively from compliant nations, in our view. We would caveat that not all Asian economies fall in this transshipment bucket, with North Asia, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore less at risk.An overall 15% effective tariff still looks likely. While Vietnam’s higher headline tariffs may appear to signal tougher outcomes elsewhere, we don’t see them as a template for other US trade talks. Vietnam is among the top 10 largest US trade partners, but less central than others now negotiating. It’s also worth noting that our forecast for an overall US effective tariff rate of 15% assumes a 30-40% rate on Chinese exports in particular. Despite the Vietnam deal’s indirect targeting of China, we note positive US-China steps this week on chip design software, ethane, and rare earths, and that there is plenty of time to reach a deal before the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause on China ends on 12 August. The US’s top two trade partners, Mexico and Canada, are on a separate track and are not subject to the 10% baseline or “reciprocal” tariffs. Both have made progress on border issues, and we think they could ultimately agree to metal quotas and to limits on Chinese transshipments. Overall, when factoring in sector-specific tariffs, potential carveouts, and some one-off less punitive bilateral deals, we think our year-end forecast for a 15% US effective tariff rate remains reasonable.More bilateral deals are likely, and that will bring more clarity. With the 9 July “reciprocal” tariff pause deadline looming, we expect the US administration to announce several country-specific deals and further extensions for countries negotiating \"in good faith,\" as well as bilateral escalations aimed at strengthening US negotiating leverage. Following the Vietnam announcement, Reuters reports Indian and US negotiators are pushing to land a deal this week, with some officials reportedly told to be on standby for a potential announcement. Japan and South Korea have expressed more difficulty in talks in public comments, but neither is walking away and could be granted extensions, in our view. We also note that purchase agreements have proven popular with the US administration.So, on balance, we take the US-Vietnam accord as a positive step toward more durable bilateral deals for the US and toward greater clarity for investors. While tariffs will likely slow US growth and add some inflation pressure into 2026, we do not expect them to derail the economy or cause a recession. Headline risks around trade may persist as negotiations continue, but we think the market impact should moderate as President Trump’s negotiating tactics become increasingly familiar. Ultimately, we expect the US administration to prioritize economic stability over more maximalist tariffs, especially ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. After the current round of “reciprocal” tariff negotiations, we think the next major milestone will likely be the announcement of sector-specific tariffs under Section 232 on pharma, semiconductors, and critical minerals later this year. We continue to recommend gradually increasing exposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for stronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond.Markets count down to tariff deadline\n 30 Jun 2025\nFrom the studioVideo:  Five things to watch in the second half, with CIO's Kiran Ganesh (3:16)Video:  CIO mid-year checklist– your next portfolio steps, with CIO's Jon Gordon (5:50)Podcast:  Jump Start – Key deadlines for US trade and fiscal policy, US-Iran talks, and jobs data (5:02)Thought of the dayGlobal equities have reached all-time highs as trade negotiations gather pace ahead of the expiration of the US “reciprocal” tariff pause next week. The S\u0026P 500 on Friday notched its first record since February this year, while the MSCI All Country World index has rallied 3.3% over the past week.Trade headlines are moving fast. Canada on Sunday night scrapped its digital services tax targeting US tech firms, just hours before it was due to take effect, after US President Donald Trump on Friday said he was terminating trade talks with Canada and threatened to set a new tariff. Following the move to drop the tax, Canada’s finance ministry said the two neighbors will resume trade negotiations in order to agree on a deal by 21 July.Such fresh twists and turns look set to dominate the final days before 9 July, potentially injecting volatility into markets that are eager for clarity over US trade policy. But we think near-term swings are unlikely to materially alter the longer-term market trajectory.The Trump administration appears to retain its escalate-to-deescalate approach. Trump has demonstrated a willingness to shock the market with tariff demands that he later modifies. He may choose to do this again in a bid to entice quicker agreements. We think the deadline is likely to pass without major escalation, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating a potential extension of the tariff pause for countries engaged in “good-faith negotiations.” In recent days, Japan and India extended their trade negotiators’ stay in Washington in hopes of reaching separate tariff agreements, while France’s finance minister praised progress in EU-US negotiations.The US is unlikely to want tariffs much higher than current levels. Senate Republicans over the weekend pushed through Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending bill, with a vote on a long list of amendments to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act scheduled for today. An estimate by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office suggests that the bill would add USD 3.3tr to the nation’s debt over a decade, about USD 800bn more than the version passed last month in the House of Representatives. While the US fiscal deficit is likely to remain elevated, it also increases the administration’s incentive to keep economic growth on track to manage and improve the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio. This means trade policies or threats that risk a recession are likely to be negotiated lower, as it is not in the Trump administration’s interest to have tariffs so high that they reduce trade, growth, and tax revenues.Tariffs at current levels should have only a moderate impact on the US economy. We expect the US administration to pursue alternative legal avenues (including product-specific tariffs) if the courts ultimately rule against the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as the basis for tariffs, keeping the eventual effective size and scope of tariffs largely similar to current levels. While this means the US effective tariff rate would represent the highest levels since the 1930s, it would still be much lower than what was announced in early April. Given the resilience of the US consumer and the adaptability of global supply chains, we believe a 15% effective tariff rate is unlikely to trigger a recession despite being a headwind to growth and a modest boost to inflation.So, while tariff headlines could periodically unsettle markets, we do not currently see them as a catalyst for a sustained market sell-off. For investors under-allocated to broad equity markets, we recommend gradually increasing exposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for stronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond.Global risk radar: Tariffs likely to remain high despite legal challenges\n 5 Jun 2025\nThe Court of International Trade’s (CIT) 28 May ruling to invalidate and permanently enjoin the vast majority of the Trump administration’s second-term tariffs is only a temporary setback, in our view.Even if the Supreme Court permanently upholds the CIT’s decision, as we expect, the administration has many legal pathways available to rebuild the tariffs.We expect the effective tariff rate to end the year around where it stands now at roughly 15%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year. Tariffs will likely remain high, as will the headline risk, but possible sudden changes in tariff negotiations and threats are becoming normalized the longer this trade war lasts.We don’t think the trade war will end in the worst outcomes, given that a collapse in trade would undermine the need for a predictable revenue stream to finance an expansive legislative agenda to cut taxes and preserve prior tax cuts.The US will likely increasingly focus its tariff pressure on countries where negotiations have stalled, such as the European Union.From a trade war to a tax war?\n 4 Jun 2025\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) currently under review by the US Senate contains some important provisions which suggest that the Trump administration is considering increasing taxes on overseas investors in the US on some types of US-source income.The OBBBA has not yet passed, and the specific consequences of the provisions may vary significantly for individual investors depending on their personal circumstances.Nonetheless, with US government debt high and rising, we believe the US will increasingly turn to financial repression measures to raise revenue, cut the interest burden, and contain yields.Irrespective of the OBBBA, we believe that US assets should remain a core holding for most global investors. In this note, we explore some strategies investors can consider to help manage potential risks associated with the OBBBA and potential future financial repression, while keeping portfolios on track.What is the OBBBA?The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a US legislative package approved by the US House of Representatives and currently under review by the US Senate.Alongside a variety of reforms, including to state and local taxes, border security, and Medicaid, two provisions have been gathering particular attention among international investors:Section 899, which would impose additional US withholding taxes (stepping up by 5% each year, capped at 20%) on certain kinds of US-source income for governments, foundations, corporations, and tax resident individuals of countries which impose “unfair foreign taxes.” Analysis from Davis Polk can be found here.Section 4475, which would impose an excise tax equal to 3.5% on cash transfers from consumers located in the US to foreign beneficiaries. Analysis by EY can be found here.As we detailed in “US fiscal outlook and the effort to contain bond yields,” we believe that with government debt high and rising, the US government may increasingly turn to financial repression measures, including using regulatory, tax, or monetary policy measures to raise revenue or cut the interest burden.Such measures, and future such measures, raise risks for investors, particularly given that the US is a core part of most global investor portfolios.How can investors manage risks associated with the OBBBA, or future US financial repression?EquitiesStrategy 1: Bring US equity exposure back to strategic benchmarksIf passed in its current form, equity dividends paid by US companies to governments, companies, or tax-resident individuals in countries which impose \"unfair taxes\" on the US may be within the scope of additional US withholding taxes under Section 899. See analysis by Davis Polk here.The US remains a critical part of the global equity market, and investors should be wary of reducing US equity exposure purely in response to potential changes in US policy. Given that US companies typically pay relatively low dividends, the effect of higher withholding taxes on US dividends may not be very meaningful (the average dividend yield on US equities is 1.3%, so an additional 5ppt withholding tax would represent 0.065% p.a). More companies may tilt even further toward share buybacks over time. And depending on personal circumstances, investors may also be able to reclaim additional US withholding taxes.At the same time, increased concerns about US policy do come on top of existing uncertainty about trade policy, the fiscal deficit, and the impact of tariffs on US economic growth, and could dent confidence in the US market. The US equity market has also rallied substantially from its recent lows. Overall, we currently think a Neutral stance on US stocks is appropriate and generally think that investors should hold US equity allocations close to strategic benchmarks.For practical purposes we believe that 50% of the equity allocation in a balanced portfolio should be allocated to US equities. Global investors with holdings substantially in excess of this should consider bringing their US equity exposure back in line with strategic benchmarks to help manage risks.Strategy 2: Consider the relative merits of holding US equities directly or via funds domiciled in different jurisdictionsOnce investors are comfortable with the \"level\" of their allocation to US equities, they can also consider the way in which they take US equity exposure. Overseas investors generally have the choice of holding US equities directly, via funds domiciled in the US, or via funds domiciled in third countries (commonly in Ireland or Luxembourg).Holding US equities directly, or via funds domiciled in the US, typically means reduced exposure to US withholding taxes and/or the increased ability to reclaim US withholding taxes, depending on individual investor circumstances. However, it may also entail increased exposure to US estate taxes.In contrast, holding US equities via funds domiciled in third countries, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, increases exposure to US dividend withholding taxes (including those under Section 899), and may reduce end-investors’ ability to reclaim such taxes. At the same time, such structures may also help limit exposure to US estate taxes and may also have other benefits, such as improved regulatory recognition in some jurisdictions.With funds domiciled in Ireland and Luxembourg likely to face higher withholding taxes on US dividends if the OBBBA passes in its current form (see analysis from KPMG here), investors may consider the relative merits of US equity funds domiciled in other jurisdictions. Changing investment vehicles can have a variety of consequences, and investors should carefully consider the merits of different investment vehicles in the context of their own personal circumstances.Fixed incomeStrategy 3: Switch some USD fixed income exposure for EUR investment gradeWe believe that most investors should apply a “home currency” focus in bonds. At the same time, we acknowledge that some investors may have good reasons to choose to diversify currency exposure and hold fixed-income exposure in currencies beyond their “home currency.”If passed in its current form, analysis by EY suggests that Section 899 does not appear to impact portfolio interest or bank deposit interest. This would imply that fixed income coupons paid by the US government or by registered US investment grade bonds would not be within the scope of additional withholding taxes.At the same time, concerns about the US taking a path toward financial repression, combined with existing fears about the US deficit, could lead to a diversification trend away from US fixed income assets. This could place near-term upward pressure on yields and downward pressure on the US dollar.In part due to our expectations of an increased diversification trend away from US dollars by international investors, we currently prefer the euro to the US dollar, and expect EURUSD to reach 1.20 by June 2026, a 6%appreciation for the euro relative to the dollar. For those that do not have a liability-driven need to own US-dollar-denominated fixed income, we like reducing some exposure to USD fixed income in exchange for additional exposure to EUR-denominated fixed income.Strategy 4: Switch US fixed income exposure for USD fixed income issued overseasInvestors who are happy with their allocation to USD fixed income can also consider whether geographically diversifying their exposure to USD fixed income may also help mitigate potential policy risks.For example, many Asian and European investment grade-rated companies issue bonds in US dollars, sometimes with higher yields than those available in US investment grade, albeit at the cost of lower liquidity. Similarly, investors can consider substituting US Treasury exposure for USD bonds issued by non-US agencies or supranational institutions. Again, this would likely mean substituting higher yields for lower liquidity.While such a switch would still leave investors exposed to the value of the US dollar and to shifts in the US yield curve (the Treasury market is still a key benchmark for global USD fixed income assets), geographic diversification can help investors limit their exposure to potentially unfavorable policy changes in any one jurisdiction.For more details, please see CIO's latest Bond Theme Focus report.Strategy 5: Consider relative merits of low-coupon bondsInvestors happy with their allocation to USD fixed income and with their level of geographic exposure to US issuers can also consider whether replacing high-coupon bonds with low-coupon bonds (with otherwise similar characteristics like credit rating, duration, and yield to maturity) may have net return benefits.By reducing current income, low-coupon bonds may reduce the potential impact of US withholding taxes on US fixed income. Low-coupon bonds may also effectively replace a domestic income tax liability for a domestic capital gains liability, which may be favorable depending on an investors’ local jurisdiction and individual circumstances.Investors reliant on a regular income stream should carefully consider other potential implications from such a switch, including the need for more active portfolio monitoring and potentially higher transaction costs. Investors should also cross-check the yield to maturity on bonds with different coupons. In markets where the majority of investors face higher taxes on coupons than on capital gains, there is also typically a moderate additional yield for high-coupon bonds compared to otherwise similar low-coupon ones.Cash and currenciesStrategy 6: We would use excess USD cash for purchases of other currencies or goldOver recent years, the US dollar has steadily strengthened, driven by strong US growth, attractive risk-adjusted yields, and the robust performance of US assets. As a result, many global investors have seen the USD share of their portfolios rise, often accumulating cash or near-cash holdings beyond what is needed for planned USD spending or investment.Now, with the US growth premium shrinking, changes in US policy, and an increasing shift among international investors to diversify dollar holdings—we believe the time has come to reconsider excess USD exposure. The effects of Section 4475, which would impose a 3.5% excise tax on remittance transfers from US bank accounts to foreign recipients (see here), should also be considered, as it may also affect some international investors with US bank accounts.In “What to do with too many US dollars?,” we considered a variety of options for investors looking to diversify USD cash exposure, including into alternative currencies like the EUR, AUD, CHF, GBP, or commodities like gold.Of course, shifting away from the USD can involve trade-offs such as lower yield, reduced liquidity, or increased volatility. Defensive currencies are often associated with negative correlation to global equity market swings but have lower yields, while cyclical and EM currencies may offer higher yields alongside higher risk.Strategy 7: Use hedged equity strategies to manage desired international currency exposures, while increasing cash and fixed income exposure in domestic marketInvestors looking to maintain their overall portfolio exposure to US dollars can also consider whether utilizing hedged equity strategies in conjunction with other changes to their fixed income or cash holdings can help them maintain a similar overall portfolio allocation to US dollars, while improving the geographic exposure of their overall portfolio.For example, an investor looking to diversify geographically while retaining their portfolio’s overall exposure to the US dollar could consider replacing existing European equity exposure with USD-hedged European equity exposure, while concurrently replacing an equivalent amount of USD fixed income with EUR fixed income.While this would entail increased exposure to the relative yield curve shape between the US and Eurozone, the overall currency profile of the portfolio and long-term expected return of the portfolio would remain broadly unchanged, and such a move would potentially improve an investors’ overall geographic diversification.Court issues tariff injunction\n 28 May 2025\nOn the evening of 28 May, the Court of International Trade (CIT) issued a unanimous and bipartisan decision requiring an immediate permanent injunction against all tariffs levied under the International Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. We wrote on 9 May in Tariff cases arrive in court, that “the court challenges represent a potentially pivotal force for lowering tariffs in the coming months and bear close attention.” The Justice Department has appealed and will seek an emergency stay to temporarily halt the ruling.The federal court’s ruling enjoins all IEEPA tariffs: the administration’s initial “trafficking” tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, the “worldwide” 10% baseline tariffs, and the additional “reciprocal” tariffs on countries running goods trade surpluses with the US. The administration has 10 days to halt the IEEPA tariffs. Tariffs applied under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Section 232) on autos, auto parts, steel and aluminum were not a subject of the court challenge and remain in effect.Tariffs will likely remain a focus for this administration, in our view, but this ruling will severely constrain the president’s use of tariffs unless the government can win on appeal. The case may ultimately reach the Supreme Court; how the court will decide is unclear. In the meantime, Section 232 and Sections 201 \u0026 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 can be used to rebuild some of the administration’s tariff agenda, but these are limited to specific products or industries and require lengthy investigations. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 gives the president very limited authority to address bilateral trade deficits with tariffs: the levy is capped at 15% and can only be applied for 150 days without an act of Congress.In our view, the administration will center its attention on its appeal of the CIT ruling and will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper, and semiconductors. These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the US’s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production. Assuming these sectors account for roughly USD 500 billion of US imports in 2024 and are assigned a 25% tariff, the US effective tariff rate would rise an additional 4 percentage points and lift revenue by another USD 100-125 billion.The product tariffs could potentially become much more important to the administration’s trade strategy following the court decision to enjoin the IEEPA tariffs. They are also likely to be more durable and feature fewer carve-outs and country exemptions because they are focused on strategic sectors. Section 232 also has a sturdier legal basis for levying tariffs compared to IEEPA because it has an historical precedent, is more targeted, and is grounded in a Commerce Department investigation.Trade negotiations will likely remain ongoing, given the impending critical product tariff announcements. These negotiations will have greater significance for countries and regions with higher export dependencies of these critical products (e.g., Taiwanese semiconductors, Chilean copper, Swiss and EU pharmaceuticals, Canadian lumber). However, the threat of reciprocal tariffs has been at least temporarily removed as negotiating leverage for the administration.The administration had hoped to rely on tariff income to lessen the deficit impact of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" Act even if it wasn’t going to be officially scored in the legislation. The CIT’s ruling will reduce expected tariff revenue if the decision holds on appeal. Prior to the ruling, we estimated that the US effective tariff rate was roughly 15% and could have generated USD 300-450 billion in annual revenues. With the decision, the effective tariff rate would fall to 6% and accordingly cut the revenue to below USD 200 billion. On the positive side, lower tariffs and less US economic harm from retaliation reduces the need for fiscal shock absorbers, like the aid to farmers who were hit during the 2018-19 trade war with mainland China.CIO Alert | Equities rebound as trade optimism returns\n 27 May 2025\nWhat happened?A risk-on mood returned to markets after the long Memorial Day weekend in the US, as investors reacted to signs of gathering momentum toward a US trade deal with the European Union.On Sunday, US President Trump announced he would push back the imposition of a 50% tariff on European Union imports from 1 June to 9 July, giving more time to reach a deal. In response, the EU on Monday agreed to accelerate trade talks. The President stated that talks were progressing in a “positive” direction.The S\u0026P 500 climbed 2% to 5,922, partially reversing last week’s 2.6% decline. Beyond trade, sentiment was boosted by a revival in US consumer confidence. The Conference Board survey pointed to the biggest monthly gain in four years. The improvement was across age and income groups, as well as political affiliation, easing fear that trade tensions would have a longer lasting impact on consumer spending.Finally, calm appeared to be returning to fixed income markets following last week’s global sell-off on worries over rising government debt. The yield on the 30-year US Treasury, which reached an intra-day high of 5.15% last week, a level last seen in October 2023, fell back below 5%. Sentiment in fixed income markets was also helped by a Reuters report that Japan’s Ministry of Finance plans to trim ultra-long issuance in response to recent turbulence.What do we think?Given the US President’s willingness to use forceful rhetoric in trade negotiations, further episodes of volatility most likely lie ahead as talks continue between the US and its top trading partners, most notably China and the EU. We do not expect a smooth path to agreement, and with the S\u0026P 500 now just 4% from its record high in February, we believe further gains this year are likely to be relatively limited.But the latest developments remain in line with our base case that pragmatism will ultimately prevail over confrontation. So far, the Trump administration has appeared to temper its more strident tariff policies in response to signs of distress in markets. We expect the effective US tariff rate to end the year around 15%. Assuming trade tensions continue to ease, we see room for the equity market rally to resume into 2026, with the S\u0026P reaching around 6,400 by June, up from 5,922 at present. The rebound in consumer confidence is also in line with our view that the resilience of the US economy will continue to underpin markets, even if growth moderates.We also remain positive on quality fixed income, despite last week’s sell-off. Concerns over rising government debt are well-founded. The “One Big Beautiful Bill” which won approval from the House of Representatives last week, is likely to add trillions to government debt over the coming decade. Meanwhile, Japan’s prime minister recently described his nation’s fiscal position as “undoubtedly extremely poor” and in Europe higher defense spending and slow economic growth will add to fiscal strains.However, reports of Japan’s plans to restrict ultra-long bond issuance, chimes with our view that policymakers will respond to excessive swings in fixed income markets if needed. The Trump administration has also already shown a willingness to shift policy in response to rapidly rising yields, including pausing the “reciprocal” tariffs that unsettled markets in April. The Fed has also indicated its readiness to act if fixed income markets become dysfunctional. Our base case is that the yield on the 10-year US Treasury will fall back to 4% by the end of 2025, helped by a resumption of Fed easing later in the year.How to invest?The public negotiating style being adopted by the Trump administration looks likely to continue leading to sporadic market swings. The challenge for investors will be to stick to their long-term plans, and exploit bouts of volatility where appropriate.Our view remains that the rally in equity markets can resume into 2026 and that the recent rise in yields offers an opportunity to lock in durable income. Against this backdrop we advise investors to:Phase into equities: We recently downgraded US equities to Neutral. Trade and fiscal uncertainty are likely to continue driving near-term volatility. But longer term we see further upside in stocks amid structural earnings growth, Fed rate cuts, and greater policy stability. Investors should use the coming months to progressively address strategic portfolio gaps and position themselves for further upside in 2026 and beyond.Seek durable income: High grade and investment grade bonds offer appealing risk-reward, in our view. We believe yields on quality bonds in most major markets are attractive, and we anticipate the continuing global rate-cutting cycle will contribute to investor inflows. We also continue to see government bonds as a credible alternative to cash for investors looking to lock in currently elevated yields. Investment grade bonds are also appealing from a portfolio risk management perspective.Sell dollar rallies: We don’t expect Tuesday’s revival in the DXY dollar index to persist over the long term, as diversification continues and as focus increases on rising fiscal deficits. We recently downgraded our view on the US dollar to Unattractive. We recommend reducing excess US dollar cash by diversifying into other currencies such as the yen, euro, pound, and Australian dollar. International investors should also review their strategic currency allocations, and consider hedging US dollar exposure in US assets back into their home currencies.Navigate political risks: We expect gold to remain a valuable long-term portfolio diversifier, supported by persistent geopolitical risks, ongoing central bank demand, and our view that real interest rates will decline as the US dollar weakens. We maintain our USD 3,500/oz target versus 3,304 at the close of trading on Tuesday. While gold may consolidate after its recent gains, price setbacks can be used to build exposure. Capital preservation strategies can also help retain gains and diversify portfolios. For investors looking to manage political risks, we recommend a mid-single-digit allocation to gold, alongside alternatives like hedge funds and capital preservation strategies on equities.Global risk radar: A pause in the trade war\n 13 May 2025\nThe vast majority of the April reciprocal tariffs have been paused following the sharp de-escalation between the US and China, but the 10% baseline tariff remains for most countries and is unlikely to be negotiated lower.The effective US tariff rate fell to roughly 15%from 25%—a level that is more conducive to generating tariff revenue than the previous higher rate that would have impaired more imports and economic activity.From here, the range of potential outcomes for US tariffs is likely more narrow than the moves that whipsawed financial markets in April and early May. Strategic product tariffs will likely bias tariffs higher even as domestic political and business pressure builds to encourage deals and exemptions. Successful legal challenges could force them lower.We retain our base case view that the effective US tariff rate settles around 15% by year-end, with a higher 30-40% tariff on China and a 10-15% tariff on the rest of the world.CIO Alert | US equities rally on US-China love: Downgrading US to Neutral\n 12 May 2025\nWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 rallied 3.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 4.4% on Monday, driven by news that the US and China have agreed to lower tariffs for 90 days while talks continue. The levy on most Chinese goods entering the US will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China will reduce the tax on US imports to 10% from 125%. Rare earth export permits for US customers may see smoother approvals following Monday's trade agreement, though full restrictions are unlikely to be lifted, according to Chinese industry sources reported on Reuters.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated, “We are in agreement that neither side wants to decouple,” highlighting the creation of a mechanism for continued talks to prevent renewed trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. This followed weekend discussions in Switzerland, where US officials reported “significant progress.”Meanwhile, US court challenges to the Trump administration’s tariffs starting this week could provide another path to lower import levies. Separately, momentum appears to be building for a ceasefire in the Russia/Ukraine war, as Ukraine's leader plans to meet with his Russian counterpart in Türkiye on Thursday.While optimism over trade talks lifted markets, pharmaceutical stocks came into focus on Monday after President Donald Trump pledged to implement what he calls “Most Favored Nation” (MFN) pricing for US prescription drugs, aligning domestic prices with the lowest available in other high-income countries. In a Truth Social post, Trump announced plans for a 59% price reduction. Shares of major pharmaceutical companies were mixed as investors grapple with the feasibility of this proposal.In addition to the rise in US equities, the Euro Stoxx 50 increased 1.6%, the Hang Seng index gained 3%, and China's CSI 300 index rose 1.2%. Gold, previously supported by safe-haven demand amid trade uncertainty, declined 3.1% to USD 3,241 per ounce.The US dollar index rose 1.4% on Monday, further highlighting a return of confidence in the US as a perceived safe haven, while the 10-year US Treasury yield rose 9bps, signaling a shift toward risk assets.What do we think?The latest announcement to pause imposed reciprocal tariffs for China by 90 days is in line with our base-case assumption that tariff rates would fall from the high announced levels. A growing docket of legal challenges and the steady erosion in presidential approval ratings are leading to gradual but substantial rollbacks in tariffs.The upcoming court challenges to the Trump administration’s tariffs could accelerate this process, and the Court of International Trade’s hearing on 13 May regarding the unprecedented use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 could play a pivotal role in determining the legality of the tariffs. While the outcome remains uncertain, these legal developments warrant close monitoring and could become a key force in lowering tariffs in the months ahead.In our view, the net effect will be that the effective tariff rate on imports into the US settles closer to 15-20% by year-end, compared to roughly 25% currently, based on 2024 import volumes. This view is predicated on a maintained rollback in the tariffs on China (settling around 30-40%) and of \"reciprocal\" tariffs for the rest of the world (settling around 10-15% by year-end).Should tariffs remain at the levels under the 90-day reprieve, we estimate that the impact on the US economy would be similar to a 2% VAT hike. It would hurt growth in the near term and push up prices, but should not trigger a full-blown recession.Aside from progress on trade talks, market sentiment may also have been helped by intensifying diplomatic pressure from European leaders calling for a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, with direct talks between Presidents Putin and Zelenskyy planned in Türkiye on Thursday. While our base case assumes a ceasefire deal will be reached this year, we expect relatively weak security guarantees for Ukraine. Increased defense spending in Europe, coupled with fiscal stimulus from Germany’s new government, should support European equities, as highlighted in our “Six ways to invest in Europe” theme.Monday’s drug pricing EO likely represents some near-term relief around the US drug pricing issue, which had been an increasing overhang over the last few weeks for the pharmaceutical sector. The EO did not introduce any new pathways to pursue MFN drug pricing. And while MFN pricing could well linger as an overhang for the pharmaceutical sector, its impact may be limited due to several factors. Legal challenges are likely, as a similar MFN executive order issued during Trump’s first term was struck down in court. Legislative hurdles also exist, we believe significant changes to drug pricing will require legislation, and media reports note that the Republican leadership in Congress has decided not to pursue MFN within its current, and already complicated, budget reconciliation process. Additionally, while the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) framework for drug pricing negotiations could incorporate MFN as a price target, any resulting discounts are likely to be incremental and limited in impact. These dynamics suggest that MFN pricing risk is likely manageable, but could also linger as a policy overhang for the biopharmaceutical sector. However, the iShares Biotechnology ETF rose 4.7% on Monday.Additionally, while the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) framework for drug pricing negotiations could incorporate most-favored-nation pricing as a \"price target,\" resulting discounts are likely to be incremental. All that said, until more clarity emerges, it is likely to represent a policy overhang for the biopharmaceutical sector, and we expect continued sector volatility in the weeks ahead.How do we invest?We downgrade US equities to Neutral from Attractive. On 10 April we upgraded our view on US equities to Attractive, based on the belief that too much trade-related fear was priced into the market. Since then, the S\u0026P 500 has rallied by 11% as progress toward de-escalation has led to a reduction in those fears. The S\u0026P 500 is now trading above the levels prevailing on 2 April when President Trump imposed “Liberation Day” tariffs, and in our view risk-reward in equities is now more balanced.While the 90-day cooling-off period has provided a reprieve, uncertainty is still high, and investors will soon begin to focus on whether this temporary fix can evolve into a lasting agreement. The constructive tone from both sides suggests a willingness to negotiate further, but challenges in forging a durable deal could lead to bouts of volatility.As a result, we downgrade US equities to Neutral from Attractive, having taken advantage of the opportunity presented by what we considered to be excessive investor pessimism. It is important to note that this is not a bearish view, nor a call to sell equities, and we recommend that investors maintain a full strategic allocation to US stocks. Over a 12-month time horizon we believe that equities will be higher than current levels.We maintain our US sector preferences, with an Attractive rating on communications services, information technology, health care, and utilities. With respect to health care, we think the recent sell-off in pharma on concerns over tariffs and drug pricing is overdone at current valuations, particularly given the legal challenges that Trump’s intended actions will likely face. The rest of the health care sector is not affected by the drug pricing executive order, and tariff exposure is manageable in our view.The pace and scale of tariff reductions agreed in this initial round have exceeded market expectations going in. If these lower tariff levels are sustained or reduced further, we could see upside risk to our full-year MSCI China earnings growth forecast (currently +5.5%). We think high-beta sectors, particularly our preferred technology names, are likely to continue outperforming. Within Chinese equities, we continue to favor growth and tech stocks and suggest investors consider tilting exposure toward select internet and China EV leaders.Looking beyond the 90-day pause, the durability of this rally will depend on two key factors: whether US-China negotiators can turn this into a lasting trade agreement, and how Beijing proceeds with anticipated stimulus now that external risks appear to be easing.More broadly, for investors who were underinvested going into this year’s sell-off and/or are willing to take on near-term risk for likely long-term reward we recommend:Phase into stocks. Phasing into the market can be an effective way to position for medium- and longer-term upside while managing timing risks and uncertainty over the coming months. Capital preservation strategies can be another way to manage near-term downside risks.Transformational Innovation Opportunities (TRIOs). We maintain strong conviction in the long-term potential of our Transformational Innovation Opportunity themes, including Artificial intelligence, Power and Resources, and Longevity. The latter theme is an opportunity for investors with a longer investment horizon looking to reap the rewards of advances in human health. If Trump succeeds in capping some prescription drug prices, this could have a short-term impact on some of the pharma stocks within this theme, but we believe the structural drivers remain intact as lifespans extend and the elderly population grows. Also, in this event, we think the Chinese pharma sector could stand to benefit from pressure on international producers to cut production and R\u0026D costs.Seek sell-off opportunities. We believe recent volatility has created select attractive opportunities at a single-stock and individual-market level, with various companies with good longer-term prospects now trading at more attractive valuations than at prior highs. In the US, we highlight 20 US companies across a range of sectors that are higher quality, have solid business models, and offer, in our view, good longer-term value (see “Sell-off opportunities” – Global,” published on 17 April 2025). In Europe, our “Six ways to invest in Europe” list focuses on defensive stocks that we believe can benefit from increased market volatility, as well as from likely higher European defense spending and fiscal stimulus.Sell dollar rallies. On Monday, the dollar rallied, with EURUSD dropping by 1.4% to 1.11. With EURUSD having risen from 1.02 to as high as 1.14 this year, we expected a consolidation in the dollar’s value, and we anticipated that any trade deals were likely to be supportive. However, over the medium term, we anticipate renewed dollar weakness as the US economy slows and focus shifts to the US's large deficits. We prefer using periods of near-term dollar strength as an opportunity to reduce USD allocations in favor of currencies such as the yen, euro, pound, and Australian dollar.Tariff cases arrive in court\n 9 May 2025\nThe Court of International Trade, a three-judge federal court based in New York City, will hear oral arguments on 13 May in the V.O.S. Selections Inc. et al v. Trump case. The plaintiffs seek damages and an injunction over the unprecedented use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to levy tariffs. President Trump used IEEPA to levy tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China based on a national emergency along the southern US border related to drug trafficking and border crossings. In early April, IEEPA formed the basis for the \"reciprocal\" tariffs and 10% universal baseline tariff.Because IEEPA has never been used as the basis for levying tariffs, there is not legal precedent to help guide how the court will rule. Thus, this case and other court challenges that will be heard later this month will likely be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. We are watching the cases closely for indications of a court-ordered injunction and the potential that the IEEPA tariffs are declared illegal.As we wrote in August 2024, recent Supreme Court decisions have sought to reduce the amount of discretion given to the executive branch and federal agencies to interpret unclear administrative statutes. In Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, the high court overturned a four-decades policy known as Chevron deference whereby lower courts deferred to administrative agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous laws or statutes. In a separate 2022 decision challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas emissions rules, the Supreme Court established that shifting electricity generation represented a “major question” with economic and political significance upon which federal agencies were not authorized to decide unless specifically granted that authority by Congress.IEEPA is silent on tariffs. Although it is widely viewed that courts will defer to the president on matters of foreign policy, the tariffs also affect domestic economic policy because of the magnitude and duration of the tariff increase. The courts will consider the major questions doctrine, given that the tariffs on China have effectively created an embargo, and the universal baseline tariffs have been levied based on a national emergency declaration over persistent US trade deficits, irrespective of whether an individual country’s bilateral trade balance is in surplus or deficit.Legal experts note that the Constitution expressly assigns Congress the power to regulate international trade and impose tariffs. Congress historically legislated tariffs until the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs of 1930. Since then, Congress has given presidents greater authority to assign tariffs, but this was also during an era of steadily lower tariffs and broadening globalization—not necessarily yielding authority to raise tariffs to levels not seen in over a century. The government’s case will note that other statutes, like Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, also don’t explicitly authorize the president to impose tariffs but have nonetheless been used widely to apply them. Yet Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 only gives the president limited authority to address bilateral trade deficits with tariffs: the levy is capped at 15% and can only be applied for 150 days without an act of Congress.We don’t know if the growing docket of court cases will influence the administration’s timeline for achieving bilateral deals to lower tariffs. If the administration is mindful of the potential for an unfavorable court ruling, it may feel greater urgency to find a path to further deescalate the trade war with China, at least in principle, this weekend in Switzerland and in the weeks to come. In our view, the court challenges represent a potentially pivotal force for lowering tariffs in the coming months and bear close attention.US stocks bounce on trade deal optimism\n 9 May 2025\nWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 climbed as much as 1.6% on Thursday before giving back some gains and closing 0.6% higher, extending its recent rebound as investors welcomed news of a trade deal framework between the US and United Kingdom—the first major agreement since the US imposed sweeping preemptive tariffs earlier this year. The announcement, made by President Trump from the Oval Office alongside UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, outlined a 10% baseline tariff on UK imports.Trump indicated the 10% UK tariff could be among the lowest for future deals, with higher rates possible for countries running large trade surpluses. He added, “final details are being written up” and expects things to be “very conclusive” in the coming weeks.Market sentiment was further buoyed as Trump expressed optimism about upcoming trade talks with China, stating he expects US negotiators to have a “good weekend” as discussions open in Switzerland. He added “I think we’re going to have a very good relationship.” This raised hopes for a thawing in relations between the world’s two largest economies, and for a significant reduction in the 145% tariff on many Chinese imports into the US.As investors rotated out of perceived safe havens, gold came under pressure. Further underscoring the risk-on mood, nearly all major segments of the equity market posted gains, with economically sensitive sectors and smalls caps leading the advance. The DXY US dollar index rose 1% on Thursday, rising back above 100, a tentative sign of returning confidence in the US as a perceived safe haven.What do we think?Since early April, when President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the bulk of planned tariff increases, our view has been that peak uncertainty over trade has passed. Our base case has been that pressure on the administration from businesses and markets would encourage productive negotiations with top trading partners. While there are likely to be plenty of twists and turns in the weeks and months ahead, recent developments are in line with this hypothesis.The tone on trade from President Trump has changed markedly in recent days. In addition to the more conciliatory tone on China and the trade framework with the UK, the administration has rolled back certain restrictions on the export of AI chips. The extensive concessions made by the UK government—including granting greater access to US farm products—could signal that other leading nations may be willing to accept uncomfortable compromises to avoid an escalating trade conflict with the US. The key test of this will be the progress of talks with China, where relations have been most strained, and the European Union.Our base case remains that the effective US tariff rate (ex-China) will moderate toward 15% by year-end. We also think that US-China tariffs will ultimately settle around 34%, as a more constructive tone and the start of high-level talks in Switzerland suggest both sides are open to deescalation and further negotiation. We expect a variety of deals or sector carve-outs to materialize before the 90-day pause period ends in July.Although trade talks remain the driving force for markets, sentiment has also been bolstered by the fact that the Fed meeting passed without alarming investors. While Powell said that the Fed was in no rush to cut rates, he stressed that this was because the US economy was still in good shape and that the Fed could move swiftly if needed. Our view is that the Fed will start cutting rates in September as evidence mounts of moderating growth and cooling labor market conditions. Our base case is for 100 basis points of further easing.How to investDuring periods of recent market volatility the temptation has been for investors to retreat from risk assets. We have consistently advised staying invested, along with various strategies to manage volatility, take advantage of volatility, and look through volatility. The recent market rebound has reinforced our confidence in this approach.Look through volatilityFor investors who were underinvested going into the sell-off and/or are willing to take on near-term risk for likely long-term reward.Phase into stocks. We continue to view US equities as Attractive, with a year-end S\u0026P 500 target of 5,800. Phasing into the market can be an effective way to position for medium- and longer-term upside while managing timing risks. Capital preservation strategies can be another way to manage near-term downside risks.Manage volatilityFor investors concerned about the near-term risks and looking to hedge portfolios against potential further downside.Gold. Despite retreating from recent all-time highs, gold has continued to serve as an effective hedge amid ongoing trade uncertainty. The precious metal has gained around 25% since the start of the year. We see further upside potential, with our base case targeting USD 3,500 per ounce in 2025. We continue to see support from investment demand, ongoing central bank diversification, and a volatile macro backdrop.Seek durable income. Recent developments have added a political risk premium to US Treasuries, reflected in a higher yield. However, we expect this to be a step change rather than an ongoing process. With yields now high, we believe US Treasuries will offer portfolio diversification benefits and should perform well in the event of a slowdown in US growth.Take advantage of volatilityFor investors unsure about the near term but looking to utilize high levels of volatility to earn additional portfolio income.Seek sell-off opportunities. We believe recent volatility has created select attractive opportunities at a single-stock and individual-market level, with various companies with good longer-term prospects now trading at more attractive valuations. In the US, we highlight 20 US companies across a range of sectors that are higher quality, have solid business models, and offer, in our view, good longer-term value (see our “Sell-off opportunities” list). In Europe, our “Six ways to invest in Europe” list focuses on defensive stocks that we believe can benefit from increased market volatility, as well as from likely higher European defense spending and fiscal stimulus.Caught our attentionBoE cuts rates by 25bps. The Bank of England (BoE) cut the policy rate by 25bps to 4.25% at its May Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, marking its fourth cut in nine months. The MPC vote was split: Seven (of nine) members voted to cut, while two voted to hold. In comments, the BoE reiterated language referring to “gradual and careful” rate cuts. It highlighted uncertainty—especially that associated with US tariffs—and “large and two-sided” risks to its revised-down forecasts. Sterling and gilt yields rose slightly on the BoE’s more hawkish-than-expected language.Our view: The MPC’s decision to ease rates Thursday is in line with market and CIO expectations. We continue to expect the BoE to proceed at a cautious pace in the coming months in order to ensure that short-term inflation pressures do not become entrenched. Thus, we expect cuts from the August and November MPC meetings and additional easing in 2026, when we expect rates to fall to the lower end of the neutral 3.0-3.5% range. Our forecasts imply a slower pace of easing by the BoE in 2025 than what markets are pricing in. Considering this and growth challenges facing the UK, we look for a EURGBP floor at 0.84, with room for the pairing to bounce back from this level should trade and growth uncertainty spike. Despite significant GBPUSD gains so far this year, we continue to expect further strength and look for the pair to reach 1.39 on a 12-month horizon.Report: NVIDIA plans downgraded AI chips for China as US export rules change. Reuters is reporting that NVIDIA is preparing to launch a downgraded version of its popular H20 AI chipset for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate around US export restrictions that have limited market access for its latest AI products. The new chip will feature “significant downgrades,” according to Reuters’ unnamed sources, including substantially reduced memory capacity. This comes as US tech leaders lobby Congress for lighter AI regulation and increased support for domestic AI infrastructure, positioning the debate squarely around US-China tech competition. Last month, the Trump administration tightened licensing requirements on AI chip exports to China, but has since signaled plans to roll back Biden-era rules that restricted exports via a tiered list of country partners. Details of a replacement regulatory framework under the Trump administration are not yet known.Our view: Demand for advanced AI chips in China remains robust despite ongoing US export curbs. But domestic Chinese producers are also focused tightly on closing the technology gap. The AI compute segment—central to global AI investment—now accounts for over half of global AI capex, and China’s spend in this area is projected to surge from USD 18bn in 2024 to USD 90bn by 2029. While Chinese chips still lag global leaders in performance, local accelerator and GPU manufacturers already command a third of China’s AI compute market, and we expect self-sufficiency to rise from just over 33%today to 90% by 2029. For investor positioning, we favor leading Chinese internet and semiconductor names as domestic AI innovation accelerates. We think continued breakthroughs in China’s AI sector, alongside signs of US-China trade deescalation, should support tech sector gains. We have upgraded China’s tech sector to Attractive, with expected earnings growth of 30% this year.Market update\n                Source: Bloomberg, Factset, UBS\n            CIO Alert: Rate cut and tariff optimism boosts stocks\n 24 Apr 2025\nWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 rose 2% on Thursday, extending its recent rebound, as strong gains in megacap technology stocks and increased expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts supported sentiment. The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced 2.7%.Expectations for a Fed rate cut increased after Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said the central bank could lower rates in June if the data is “convincing,” but emphasized that “patience will be essential” in assessing the economic outlook.As the first-quarter earnings season gathers momentum, strong results from major companies have helped boost sentiment and drive stocks higher. Of the S\u0026P 500 companies that have reported so far, around 70% have beaten earnings estimates, with 1Q earnings on track to grow by roughly 5% year over year.Gold, which had retreated from its record high above USD 3,500 per ounce earlier in the week, rebounded 1.7% to USD 3,332/oz at the time of writing, reflecting ongoing market volatility.While investor optimism this week has been buoyed by President Trump’s signals of a less confrontational approach to trade talks with Beijing, mixed messages persist. China’s Ministry of Commerce stated that no trade talks are currently taking place and called for the US to remove all “unilateral” tariffs.The S\u0026P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have rallied over the past three sessions. However, both indexes have fallen over the course of April and are on track for a third consecutive monthly decline. With uncertainty around US tariff policy and the Fed’s next steps still in focus, markets are likely to remain sensitive to further developments.What do we think?Markets are now factoring in both a Trump and a Fed \"put,\" in line with our base case that tariffs will be reduced from current announced levels over the remainder of the year and that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates further in 2025. However, with uncertainty still elevated around trade, the economy, and Fed policy, we expect volatility to remain elevated as well.On trade, we believe the Trump administration’s change in its tariff stance in response to equity and bond market turbulence indicates some sensitivity to market stress, which points to the existence of a “Trump put” in some form. The latest CNBC All-America economic survey found that President Trump now has a net negative approval rating on the economy (43% approval, 55% disapproval) for the first time.With many countries expressing a desire to negotiate with the US on tariff policy, and the Trump administration now somewhat pressured to demonstrate “success,” we expect a variety of deals or sector carveouts to materialize within the 90-day pause period.Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack’s remarks on Thursday sharpened the market’s focus on monetary policy. While her comments raised the likelihood of further easing, she reiterated the Fed’s emphasis on patience. Nonetheless, we believe the central bank remains prepared to respond to signs of economic weakness, particularly in the labor market. Our base case is that the Fed will cut interest rates by 75-100 basis points this year. But in the very near term, the Fed’s policy flexibility appears to be more limited, as it has to balance growth concerns against the risk of a resurgence in inflation.While tariffs will be a near-term overhang, it is important to see this in the context of strong longer-term corporate earnings potential. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reinforced this momentum by reporting its fiscal first-quarter results after the market close on Thursday, beating consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue. In recent years the performance of the US technology sector has been a key driver of the US equity market. While we expect tariffs to contribute to earnings per share cuts of 3-5% for 2025, tech earnings should still grow by a mid-teens percentage this year, in our view. We expect strong global AI capex spend to continue, growing by 60% in 2025 to reach USD 360bn, and 33% in 2026 to reach USD 480bn. Recent earnings results have reinforced this outlook, with companies reporting robust growth and surpassing analyst expectations.How to investAt times of elevated volatility and heightened uncertainty, we recommend the following strategies:Look through volatilityFor investors who were under-invested going into the sell-off or are willing to take on near-term risk for likely long-term reward.Phase into stocks. While volatility will likely persist, we view US equities as Attractive, with a year-end S\u0026P 500 target of 5,800. Phasing into the market can be an effective way to position for medium- and longer-term upside while managing timing risks. Capital preservation strategies can be another way to manage near-term downside risks.Transformational Innovation Opportunities (TRIOs). We continue to see strong long-term potential in our TRIOs— Artificial intelligence, Longevity, and Power and resources. While companies exposed to each of these ideas have been caught up in near-term derisking, we expect structural trends to be the biggest drivers over the long term, and the recent sell-off provides a potential opportunity for investors to build structural exposure.Manage volatilityFor investors concerned about the near-term risks and looking to hedge portfolios against potential further downside.Gold. Gold has continued to serve as an effective hedge amid ongoing trade uncertainty. The precious metal has gained 26% since the start of the year. And we see further upside potential, with our base case targeting USD 3,500 per ounce by year-end versus USD 3,332/oz at the time of writing. We continue to see support from investment demand, ongoing central bank diversification, and a volatile macro backdrop.Seek durable income. Recent developments have added a political risk premium to US Treasuries, reflected in a higher yield. However, we expect this to be a step change rather than an ongoing process. With yields now high, we believe US Treasuries will offer portfolio diversification benefits and should perform well in the event of a slowdown in US growth.Take advantage of volatilityFor investors unsure about the near term but looking to utilize high levels of volatility to earn additional portfolio income.Seek sell-off opportunities. We believe recent volatility has created select attractive opportunities at a single-stock and individual-market level, with various companies with good longer-term prospects now trading at more attractive valuations. In the US, we highlight 20 US companies across a range of sectors that are higher quality, have solid business models, and offer, in our view, good longer-term value (see “Sell-off opportunities – Global,” published on 17 April). In Europe, our “Six ways to invest in Europe” list focuses on defensive champions that can benefit from increased market volatility, as well as from likely higher European defense spending and fiscal stimulus.For more, read our latest Monthly Letter: Managing exceptionalismCIO Alert: US stocks rebound on hopes over trade and earnings\n 22 Apr 2025\nWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 recouped part of its recent lost ground, rising 2.5% on Tuesday, on positive signals from the Trump administration over trade talks and hopes that the earnings season will revive market sentiment.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, speaking in a closed-door session at an investor summit, reportedly described the current tariff standoff with China as unsustainable and said he expects the situation to de-escalate. Bessent noted that while negotiations have not yet begun, a deal remains possible, according to attendees. The US reported “significant progress” toward a bilateral trade deal with India, with calls for increased purchases of American goods following talks between Vice President JD Vance and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In addition, the White House said it was close to a deal with Japan.The stabilization in markets may also reflect that the ongoing first quarter earnings season is not turning out to be as bad as feared, even though the percentage of companies beating sales and earnings estimates has so far been below historical averages. Despite the high degree of uncertainty and very weak consumer sentiment, companies have suggested that consumer spending remains generally resilient. Encouragingly, banks are not pulling back from lending or supporting customers.The positive signals on trade negotiations shifted attention from concerns that President Trump may try to dislodge Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling into question the independence of the central bank and thus the outlook for price stability.The yield on the 30-year US Treasury, which rose on worries over political interference with the Fed, fell modestly. Gold reached a fresh record high on Tuesday, climbing above USD 3,500 an ounce, continuing to benefit from investor uncertainty. However, the precious metal later retreated.What do we think?The more conciliatory tone from the White House on trade talks is in line with our view that a worst-case scenario on tariffs can be avoided. Our base case is that the effective US tariff rate ex-China will settle in the 10–15% range, with Canada and Mexico remaining largely exempt. While the twists and turns of trade negotiations are likely to keep volatility elevated, recent signals suggest a more constructive approach to resolving disputes.Tariffs and uncertainty will weigh on economic and corporate profit growth in the near term. But we expect growth to resume later this year and into 2026 as the economy adapts. Investor sentiment should recover as confidence in the underlying fundamentals returns. Despite headwinds for tech, recent earnings from semi supply chain companies pointed to solid underlying AI demand, and AI adoption rates in the US have been encouraging. We remain confident in AI’s growth story and expect a manageable 3–5% earnings impact on global tech companies from the tariffs.Finally, regarding the Fed, markets will remain alert to any signs of political interference. But while President Trump may continue to publicly criticize Chair Powell, he said on Tuesday that he has “no intention” of firing the Federal Reserve Chair. Thus, we think the likelihood of Powell’s removal remains low before his term ends in May 2026. In addition, although Powell has signaled a wait-and-see approach, we believe the central bank will be prepared to respond to signs of economic weakness, particularly in the labor market, and our base case is for 75–100 basis points of rate cuts this year. This should also support market sentiment.How to investRecent developments are a reminder that market swings are likely until there is greater certainty over the outlook for tariffs. Against this backdrop, we recommend various strategies.Manage volatilityFor investors concerned about the near-term risks and looking to hedge portfolios against potential further downside.GoldGold has continued to serve as an effective hedge amid ongoing trade uncertainty, taking its gains since the start of the year to 27% at the time of writing. Despite this strong performance, we see further upside potential, with our base case targeting USD 3,500 an ounce by year-end versus 3,362 at the time of writing. We continue to see support from investment demand, ongoing central bank diversification, and a volatile macro backdrop.Diversify with hedge fundsBy dynamically adapting to macro shifts, hedge fund strategies like discretionary macro, equity market neutral, select relative value, or multi-strategy can cushion portfolios in down markets. We believe the alpha orientation and conservative posture of multi-strategy funds will mean near-term performance is likely to be largely insulated from market volatility. Similarly, macro strategies should, in our view, generate positive outcomes amid the volatility. Investors, however, should be aware of the unique drawbacks inherent in hedge funds, such as illiquidity and a lack of transparency.Seek durable incomeRecent developments have added a political risk premium to US Treasuries, reflected in a higher yield.

This rekindled concerns that the Fed could be hampered in its ability to support the economy.Powell said that President Trump’s tariffs had been “significantly larger than anticipated” and may place the Fed in a \"challenging\" position by fueling higher inflation and slower growth. He added that policymakers would “wait for greater clarity” before adjusting policy. His comments undermined recent confidence that the Fed would view any boost to inflation resulting from tariffs as transitory.The speech followed news that the Trump administration had imposed restrictions on AI chipmaker NVIDIA’s exports to China, creating headwinds for the US tech sector and pointing to a further deterioration in relations between the world’s two largest economies. NVIDIA shares fell 6.9% on the day, after disclosing that new government licensing requirements for its H20 AI chip would result in a USD 5.5 billion charge, while AMD also warned of up to USD 800 million in costs from similar controls.Gold rallied 3.6% to USD 3,334/oz and US 10-year Treasury yields fell 5bps to 4.28%. The US dollar fell against the euro with EURUSD +1% to 1.14.What do we think?Despite the latest setback in relations between the US and China, we think it is more likely than not that a compromise can be reached over coming months. While it could take some time, we believe the US and China will walk back from the recent tit-for-tat escalation, and that US-China tariffs will settle at around 34%. President Trump has said he would “love” to make a deal with China. Overall, we expect the effective US tariff rate ex-China to settle in the 10-15% range, and Canada and Mexico to remain largely exempt from tariffs.We also do not take Fed Chair Powell’s comments as ruling out rate cuts if growth weakens. For now, Fed officials are keen to stress to markets that they want to prevent any increase in prices arising from higher tariffs from turning into a more sustained bout of higher inflation. But we believe the Fed will be willing and able to respond to signs of economic weakness, especially rising layoffs. Our base case is that the Fed will cut by 75-100 basis points this year.How to investRecent developments are a reminder that market swings are likely until there is greater certainty over the outlook for tariffs. Against this backdrop, we recommend various strategies to manage volatility.Take advantage of volatilityWith volatility likely to remain high in the near term, investors should prepare to use swings in the market to diversify and strengthen portfolios for the longer term. We believe that strategies that gradually phase in to equities or balanced portfolios can be effective ways to navigate volatility while building investments for the future. We believe that US equities will end the year higher than today and rate them Attractive.GoldAn adequate allocation of gold has proven a helpful cushion against uncertainty over trade. The precious metal was trading at an all-time high of 3,334 USD an ounce on Wednesday, taking its gains for the year to around 26%. Despite this strong run, we believe gold can advance further, and our base case is that the price will reach USD 3,500 an ounce this year. Along with simmering geopolitical tensions, gold is benefiting from worries that higher tariffs will kindle inflation.Diversify with hedge fundsBy dynamically adapting to macro shifts, hedge fund strategies like discretionary macro, equity market neutral, select relative-value, or multi-strategy can cushion portfolios in down markets. We believe that the alpha orientation and conservative posture of multi-strategy funds will mean near-term performance is likely to be largely insulated from market volatility. Similarly, we expect that macro strategies should generate positive outcomes amid the volatility. Investors, however, should be aware of the unique drawbacks inherent in hedge funds, such as illiquidity and a lack of transparency.Seek durable incomeQuality bonds can help dampen portfolio volatility, and we currently see the risk-reward outlook as appealing. Despite the recent period in which Treasuries fell in tandem with stocks, we believe the broadly negative correlation between stock and bond returns should hold over the longer term.CIO Alert | Trade war: Strengthening portfolios in volatile times\n 10 Apr 2025\nIn this note we detail why we now see US equities as Attractive, how we believe investors can strengthen and diversify their portfolios during volatile times, and we update our scenario analysis considering the “90-day” pause to tariffs on most countries announced by President Trump on 9 April.We upgrade US equities to AttractiveWe see three reasons for a more positive outlook for US stocks:President Trump’s policy shift has reduced extreme economic and market tail risks.President Trump’s 2 April “Liberation Day” tariff announcements were harsher than expected and have been followed by tit-for-tat escalation between the US and China, with US tariffs on imports from China now totaling 145%. But President Trump on 9 April also announced a 90-day pause on “reciprocal tariffs” for other countries.We believe the demonstrated willingness from the Trump administration to change its stance in response to equity and bond market turbulence indicates some sensitivity to market stress, and points to the existence of a “Trump put” in some form.To be sure, the significant tariffs on China will cause economic disruption if they remain in place. But while downside risks do remain, we believe the risk of a more severe economic downturn is now more limited. We have raised our downside scenario S\u0026P 500 price target to 4,500 (which we consider to be more aligned with a \"normal\" recession), up from 4,000 (more consistent with a systemic crisis like the global financial crisis).Incremental news flow is likely to improve.We remain mindful of the greater-than-expected tariff escalation between the US and China, and the risk that incoming data could demonstrate significant supply chain and business disruption from the China tariffs. It is also not certain that the pause in “reciprocal tariffs” on other trading partners will result in more long-lasting “deals,” and we do expect additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors to be announced.But with many countries expressing a desire to negotiate with the US, and the Trump administration now more incentivized to demonstrate “success,” we expect a variety of “deals” or sector carveouts to materialize within the 90-day “pause” period. President Trump has even expressed the view that ultimately a deal would be struck with China. We believe that progress on negotiations should provide encouragement for investors to look through near-term tariff-induced economic weakness and toward a return to earnings growth in 2026.Equity returns after volatile periods have historically been positive.Since 1990, when the VIX index was launched, the S\u0026P 500 has delivered 9.3% returns on average over a 12-month period. High volatility has historically been followed by higher-than-normal returns. While each case is different, levels of the VIX above 40 (the index reached a high of 60 on 7 April and trades above 50 at the time of writing) have historically been followed on average by 30% one-year returns on the S\u0026P 500, with a 95% chance of a gain.Additionally, the S\u0026P 500’s 9.5% rally on 9 April was the largest one-day rise since 2008, and the third largest ever. Since 1950, there have been 13 previous one-day rallies of 6% or more; subsequent one-year returns have all been positive with gains ranging from 10-63%.We also found that on the 12 occasions that the S\u0026P 500 has fallen by 20%from its peak since 1945, the index has delivered a positive return over the subsequent 12 months on 67% of occasions with a mean return of 12.9%. The S\u0026P 500 closed down almost 20% from its peak on 8 April.Furthermore, bearish sentiment among individual investors remains elevated due to uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trade dispute. According to the latest American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) survey for the week ending 9 April, 58.9% of investors continue to hold a bearish outlook, anticipating that stock prices will decline over the next six months. This follows a surge to a one-year high of 61.9% the previous week. Notably, bearish sentiment has historically served as a contrarian indicator, with the S\u0026P 500 averaging a 27% return in the 12 months following instances where sentiment readings exceed 60%.Strengthening and diversifying portfolios in volatile times“Phasing in”We see US equities as Attractive and note that periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility and stay the course or put fresh money to work. At the same time, investing during times of elevated volatility can be challenging, as market timing risks are also more elevated.One way to mitigate market entry risks is by using a phasing-in strategy. Since 1945, phasing into a balanced 60/40 portfolio over 12 months has outperformed cash in approximately 74% of one-year periods and 83% of three-year periods. When initiated after a market decline of over 10%, this strategy outperformed cash in 82% of one-year periods and 94% of three-year periods.Capital preservation strategiesFor investors uncomfortable with volatility but looking to position for potential future gains, capital preservation strategies may offer a solution. These approaches combine investment in zero-coupon bonds with call options, providing exposure to equity market rallies while limiting potential losses. Investors can tailor these instruments to their risk tolerance, choosing between full capital preservation or accepting limited downside risk for greater participation in potential gains.GoldGold prices came under some pressure after “Liberation Day” owing to investor deleveraging, but the yellow metal has resumed its upward trajectory this week, trading as high as USD 3,176/oz on 10 April.We believe gold prices will remain well-supported by the uncertain trade and geopolitical backdrop as well as the potential for swifter rate cuts from the Fed, which lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. We believe gold will continue to offer portfolio diversification benefits, particularly in adverse scenarios. In our base case, we target gold prices of USD 3,200/oz.Quality bonds10-year US Treasury yields now stand at 4.42%, compared to our year-end target of 4.0%. This anticipated bond rally should offer respectable total return potential and diversification benefits for portfolios. In a downside scenario, we would expect 10-year Treasury yields to fall to 2.5%, offering potentially significant capital gains for investors. Investors at the longer end of the yield curve need to remain mindful of volatility related to fiscal concerns and the unwinding of technical hedge fund “basis trades.”Hedge fundsBy dynamically adapting to macro shifts, hedge fund strategies—like discretionary macro, equity-market neutral, select relative value or multi-strategy—can cushion portfolios in volatile and down markets, and potentially prosper amid a fast-changing macroeconomic environment.Our updated scenariosBase case (50% probability)S\u0026P 500: 5,800\n   US 10-year yield: 4.0%In our base case, we believe that equities will remain volatile but rise over the balance of the year owing to various trade “deals” and carveouts, central bank rate cuts, and progress toward a US budget reconciliation bill.On tariffs, we expect the coming months to bring additional tariffs on sectors including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors but also negotiated carveouts for other sectors as well as the announcement of “deals” with specific countries. We also expect the “90-day pause” to be extended where necessary.Overall, we expect the effective US tariff rate ex-China to settle in the 10-15%range, and Canada and Mexico to remain largely exempt from tariffs. While it could take some time, we also think the US and China will walk back from the recent tit-for-tat escalation, and US-China tariffs settle around 34%. President Trump has said he would “love” to make a deal with China.Despite the “90-day pause,” the US economy is likely to experience a notable slowdown owing to weaker consumer confidence and potential disruptions related to exceptionally high tariffs on China. We expect the US economy to grow by less than 1% on average in 2025 but expect the unemployment rate to remain below 5%. Other global economies are also likely to experience weaker growth in 2025, but we expect growth rates to remain positive for the full year. Policy stimulus in Europe and China may help to partially offset the negative effect on economic activity.Despite higher near-term inflation in the US, we expect all major central banks (except the Bank of Japan) to ease policy gradually from mid-2025. We expect the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 75-100bps in 2025 and the European Central Bank to cut rates by 25bps every meeting until mid-2025.Downside scenario (30% probability)S\u0026P 500: 4,500\n   US 10-year yield: 2.5%In our downside “hard landing” scenario, equities would fall further as tariff negotiations generally do not succeed, and pressure on US domestic demand triggers a US recession. High-quality bonds would appreciate as growth expectations are revised materially lower, more than offsetting fiscal concerns.In this scenario, tariff negotiations in the weeks ahead do not prove productive, with some countries retaliating against the US’ 10% “baseline tariffs.” The US and EU struggle to reach an agreement due to issues ranging from “baseline tariff” levels, defense spending, and digital services taxes. Overall, we would expect effective tariffs ex-China to settle in the 15-20%range in this scenario. Although we think the US and China could partially reduce current extraordinary tariffs in excess of 100%, we think US tariffs on China would remain over 60% by year-end.The persistent disruption to global trade in this scenario leads to sustained downward pressure on US domestic demand, and the US economy enters a recession (c. -2% peak to trough), with unemployment rising by around 2pps. At the same time, we think that policy flexibility from the Trump administration would limit potentially more severe economic downside scenarios.In this scenario, central banks may adopt a cautious approach to monetary easing in the near term for fear of de-anchoring inflation expectations. However, we think rates would be cut sharply later in the year as central banks try to revive growth and remain mindful of risks to financial stability. The Fed lowers its policy interest rate by around 300bps by year-end.Upside scenario (20% probability)S\u0026P 500: 6,500\n   US 10-year yield: 4.75%While an upside scenario may be hard to envisage, we think investors should remain cognizant that equity markets could rally very significantly if trade agreements are reached more quickly and comprehensively than expected, including with the EU or China.In this scenario, growth would still prove lumpy in the immediate future, but lower tariff risks and healthy consumption would allow the US economy to surprise positively thereafter, with residual negative tariff effects also potentially offset by policy support from deregulation and a potential US fiscal package.CIO Alert | Trade war: Equity markets rebound on tariff pause\n 9 Apr 2025\nWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 climbed 9.5% on Wednesday, its largest daily gain since 2008, after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for countries that had so far refrained from retaliating.The statement kindled hopes of averting a global trade war. However, the President singled out China, the largest exporter to the US, and subsequently raised its tariffs to 125%, up from 104% earlier in the day. In addition, the White House stressed that the “baseline” 10% tariff on imports from most other nations would remain in effect during the 90-day pause. This follows Tuesday’s executive order tripling the tariff on smaller parcels from China valued at less than USD 800 from 30% to 90% effective 2 May—a move that affects an estimated annual USD 40-45 billion of largely e-commerce imports.The shift in US policy came after further signs of escalation earlier in the day, with both China and the EU unveiling higher tariffs on imports from the US. President Trump also reiterated Wednesday that he would soon unveil levies on the pharmaceutical sector, which has so far been exempt. The pharma sector underperformed the broader market on Wednesday, rising 2.8%.There were also signs earlier in the day that the uncertainty around trade had started to generate instability in the US Treasury market. The 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 4.51% after trading as low as 3.87% on Monday—a pattern that goes against the grain of normal safe-haven inflows into US government bonds. Reports of foreign selling, a flight to liquidity, and hedge funds unwinding leveraged “basis trades” added to the pressure. Conditions improved later on Wednesday, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 4.3%, in part owing to strong auction demand.What do we expect?Market volatility is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead as investors assess rapidly shifting tariff developments and consider the potential implications for growth, inflation, central bank policy, and financial markets.Our base case (50% probability) has been for higher tariffs in the near term, followed by gradual rollbacks as political, business, and legal challenges mount, trading partners offer concessions, and/or as popular support for the Trump administration falls.Trump’s post on Wednesday opens the door to potential tariff reduction “deals” for many trading partners. We believe this approach from the US administration is consistent with an “escalate to deescalate” strategy toward much of the world.At the same time, we remain mindful of the greater-than-expected escalation between the US and China, the precise details of the latest US policy shift have yet to be announced, and it is not certain that the proposed pause will hold.Despite Wednesday’s announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the US and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies. We currently estimate the overall US effective tariff rate at 27% (versus 9% prior to 2 April). Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%.In our base case, we expect tariff moderation and Fed rate cuts to support a rebound in the S\u0026P 500 to 5,800 by year-end, despite slowing US growth. We see the 10-year Treasury yield declining to 4.0%.In an upside scenario (20% probability), equity markets continue to rebound sharply amid a more permanent resolution of trade disputes, the avoidance of a material slowdown in growth, and optimism about the impact of AI on earnings. In this scenario, the S\u0026P 500 ends the year around 6,500.How to invest?The rebound in global markets offers investors an opportunity to take stock, diversify portfolios, and prepare for what we still believe is likely to be a volatile second quarter, while positioning for what we still expect to be longer-term upside.Review your planThe recent market swings have underlined the appeal of the UBS Wealth Way* approach, which helps families segment their wealth—based on their purpose and time horizon—into three strategies using the Liquidity. Longevity. Legacy. framework. Investors with a well-funded Liquidity strategy can confidently look through volatility and focus on action items within their control.Navigate political risksImplied volatility has dropped dramatically in light of President Trump’s announcement, meaning that strategies with a degree of capital preservation are now more attractively priced. Substituting existing direct exposure for such strategies can be an effective way for investors to manage potential ongoing risks that could arise from a renewed change in tariff policy.The recent weakness in gold prices offers an opportunity for investors to build exposure to an asset which we think will continue to offer portfolio diversification benefits, particularly in adverse scenarios. In our base case, we target gold prices of USD 3,200/oz.Seek durable incomeThe increase in bond yields in volatile trading in recent days offers investors respectable total return potential with added diversification benefits for portfolios.In a downside scenario we would expect 10-year Treasury yields to fall to 2.5%, offering potentially significant capital gains for investors. Investors at the longer end of the yield curve need to remain mindful of volatility related to fiscal concerns and the unwinding of technical hedge fund “basis trades.”Diversify with hedge fundsBy dynamically adapting to macro shifts, hedge fund strategies like discretionary macro, equity-market neutral, select relative value or multi-strategy can cushion portfolios in volatile and down markets, and potentially prosper amid a fast-changing macroeconomic environment.Take advantage of volatilityWe continue to see strong long-term potential in our Transformational Innovation Opportunities (TRIO)—Artificial intelligence, Longevity, and Power and Resources. While companies exposed to each of these ideas have been caught up in near-term derisking, we expect structural trends to be the biggest drivers over the long term.Investors can manage market timing risks while building up allocations through phasing approaches. Since 1945, we find that a strategy to phase into a balanced 60/40 portfolio of S\u0026P 500 and US government bonds over the course of 12 months and then holding has outperformed cash (three-month Treasury bills) in ~74% of one-year periods and ~83% of three-year periods. Strategies which started to phase into 60:40 diversified portfolios when the S\u0026P 500 is more than 10% off its peak have outperformed cash in ~82% of one-year periods and ~94% of three-year periods.Trade the range in currenciesIn the near term, we see an opportunity to benefit from currently elevated levels of currency volatility by trading what we expect to be near-term ranges in key pairs, including EURUSD (centered around 1.10), USDCHF (centered around 0.86), and GBPUSD (centered around 1.31).Over the medium term, we believe a more sustained period of weakness for the US dollar is likely, particularly if the Fed cuts interest rates more quickly than expected in response to weakness in US economic growth. Investors looking to position for longer-term dollar weakness while monetizing short-term volatility can consider selling the risk of a higher US dollar.\n *UBS Wealth Way is an approach incorporating Liquidity.

What\n\n15\nI think we're going to get over the near\n\n16\nterm is frankly a lot more volatility and\n\n17\nbad news. There will be reactions from\n\n18\nother countries and I\n\n19\nthink the US administration\n\n20\nwill then push back against that and so\n\n21\nwe will end up with a\n\n22\nUS versus the rest of the\n\n23\nworld type conflict. However, over time,\n\n24\nI think the US Congress,\n\n25\nthe US courts, politics,\n\n26\nbusiness will put a lot of pressure on\n\n27\nthe US administration\n\n28\nto dial back on the trade\n\n29\ntaxes that they've been imposing and so\n\n30\nby the end of the\n\n31\nyear, I wouldn't say we're\n\n32\ngoing to get rid of these taxes but I\n\n33\nthink that the effective\n\n34\ntariff rate, which is what\n\n35\neconomists care about, is probably going\n\n36\nto be quite a bit lower.\n\n37\nSo what do you think will be the impact\n\n38\non growth if we get\n\n39\nthis phase where perhaps\n\n40\nit gets worse but then it gets better?\n\n41\nHow will growth evolve\n\n42\nover the next few quarters?\n\n43\nIt really depends on when we dial back\n\n44\nbecause the longer this\n\n45\ngoes on for the more disruptive\n\n46\nit is going to be for the US economy in\n\n47\nparticular. The US economy\n\n48\nwill be more severely damaged\n\n49\nbut also obviously for the global\n\n50\neconomy. So we are skirting\n\n51\nwith a recession. If there\n\n52\nis a withdrawal of these tariffs, let's\n\n53\nsay within the next\n\n54\nthree to four months, then\n\n55\nI think we can just about avoid that\n\n56\nbecause of course the US\n\n57\neconomy was starting this\n\n58\nyear with a really solid foundation of\n\n59\ngrowth. So we've got that\n\n60\nto cling onto. If however\n\n61\nthe tariffs drag on into the second half,\n\n62\ninto the fourth quarter, then I think the\n\n63\nUS picture becomes a lot more negative\n\n64\nand that's not just\n\n65\nbecause we're disrupting\n\n66\ntrade, it's because you're creating\n\n67\nuncertainty which is a deterrent to\n\n68\ninvestment and because\n\n69\nconsumers I think quite likely will start\n\n70\nto worry about job security and that was\n\n71\nof course the success story of the last\n\n72\nfour years. Consumers\n\n73\nweren't worried about employment\n\n74\nand they were happy to spend. If the US\n\n75\nconsumer starts to fear\n\n76\nfor their jobs, that becomes\n\n77\nmore problematic. What do you think about\n\n78\nthe inflation outlook? I guess on the one\n\n79\nhand tariffs may raise some prices but on\n\n80\nthe other hand you've\n\n81\ngot perhaps oversupply\n\n82\nof goods in other places. So how does\n\n83\nthat all come together?\n\n84\nWell let's start with the\n\n85\nmarkets. So you've got the first round\n\n86\neffect of the tariffs and\n\n87\nthat will push up inflation.\n\n88\nI would estimate somewhere between 1.7\n\n89\npercentage points and\n\n90\nprobably two and a half percentage\n\n91\npoints on the current tariffs. A little\n\n92\ndifficult to be precise about this\n\n93\nbecause it does depend\n\n94\non how quickly some of these are dialled\n\n95\nback. But then you've got\n\n96\ntwo second round effects\n\n97\nwhich we really need to monitor because\n\n98\nthis is something the\n\n99\nFed in particular would be\n\n100\nmore concerned about. The first of these\n\n101\nis US companies\n\n102\nchoosing to raise prices as\n\n103\ntariffs go up because if your foreign\n\n104\ncompetitor's price goes up\n\n105\nyou can raise your price without\n\n106\nany loss of market share. So that would\n\n107\nbe the second round\n\n108\neffect that would add to\n\n109\ninflation. And then the other thing is\n\n110\nwhether we get an episode\n\n111\nof profit led inflation.\n\n112\nOne is starting to talk about tariffs in\n\n113\nthe States obviously.\n\n114\nAnd so in that circumstance\n\n115\nretailers can get away with price\n\n116\nincreases and say it's all\n\n117\nthe fault of tariffs when\n\n118\nin actual fact there's a bit of margin\n\n119\nexpansion going on there.\n\n120\nSo that's your inflationary\n\n121\nstory. Now outside of the States of\n\n122\ncourse the rest of the\n\n123\nworld is still trading with\n\n124\none another in a more or less normal way.\n\n125\nThe US is suffering a growth shock and an\n\n126\ninflation shock. We've already seen for\n\n127\nexample oil prices\n\n128\ncoming down because of reduced\n\n129\ndemand from the United States or\n\n130\nanticipation of reduced\n\n131\ndemand. We may also start to see\n\n132\nincreased supply of goods into local\n\n133\nmarkets. Now we've got to be a bit\n\n134\ncareful here because\n\n135\nthere will also obviously be tariffs on\n\n136\nUS products,\n\n137\nrestrictions on US products coming\n\n138\ninto Europe, UK and Asia. And there will\n\n139\nalso be I think\n\n140\nheightened sensitivity on the\n\n141\npart of Europe and the UK in particular\n\n142\nabout we don't want China\n\n143\nto be dumping goods into\n\n144\nEurope and the UK. I don't think China\n\n145\nwill necessarily go down\n\n146\nthat route. It's not in\n\n147\ntheir interests. This is a time when\n\n148\nEurope, UK, China are going\n\n149\nto perhaps be collaborating\n\n150\na bit more against a more hostile US\n\n151\npolicy. As you said\n\n152\nearlier there's quite a lot of\n\n153\nuncertainty about the tariffs themselves\n\n154\nand how long they last.\n\n155\nBut it does seem as though\n\n156\nthe US is trying to establish quite a\n\n157\ndifferent relationship with\n\n158\nthe rest of the world in a\n\n159\nnumber of areas than it has in recent\n\n160\nhistory. Could you map out\n\n161\nhow you think the world looks\n\n162\nthree years from now if we continue on\n\n163\nthis current trajectory?\n\n164\nSo that is that's quite a\n\n165\ndark picture I think because it will be a\n\n166\ndisruption of what people in the\n\n167\nfinancial markets have been\n\n168\nused to really for you know 80 years or\n\n169\nmore. What I would suggest\n\n170\nthough the first point we\n\n171\nshould always cling to is that people are\n\n172\nvery good at adapting to a\n\n173\ncrisis. We saw this in the\n\n174\npandemic, we see this around natural\n\n175\ndisasters, people do adapt\n\n176\nin the face of a crisis and\n\n177\nbusinesses will adapt in the face of an\n\n178\nupheaval which would\n\n179\neffectively be ending the post-war\n\n180\neconomic system. It's also important to\n\n181\nremember we are not in the\n\n182\n1930s. This is not a global\n\n183\ntrade war, this is the US fighting with\n\n184\neverybody else. So far Europe, UK\n\n185\npossibly getting closer\n\n186\ntogether, Europe, China not pursuing\n\n187\nantagonistic policies. So\n\n188\nthis is really about the United\n\n189\nStates perhaps isolating itself from the\n\n190\nrest of the world. If we\n\n191\nassume these tariffs continue\n\n192\nover the course of the next two to three\n\n193\nyears I would then expect\n\n194\nprobably a closer relationship\n\n195\nbetween the UK and Europe not reversing\n\n196\nthe Brexit process but certainly\n\n197\ndiminishing some of the more\n\n198\nnegative aspects of that around trade. I\n\n199\nthink that we would see ongoing trade\n\n200\nbetween Asia and Europe\n\n201\nand the UK so that part of global trade\n\n202\nwould be continued. Supply\n\n203\nchains I think will continue to\n\n204\nlocalise, that's a trend that was already\n\n205\nhappening but it may be\n\n206\naccelerated by this process. The\n\n207\ndollar I think will be used less as a\n\n208\nglobal currency. Now I want\n\n209\nto be clear I do not think\n\n210\nthe dollar loses its reserve status but\n\n211\nit's one of five or six\n\n212\nglobal reserve currencies at the\n\n213\nmoment and I think it can certainly\n\n214\ncontinue to lose market share because\n\n215\nit's lost a little bit of\n\n216\nmarket share in the recent past. That\n\n217\nwill continue if this isolationist\n\n218\nstrategy, this very strong\n\n219\neconomic nationalism continues. But on\n\n220\nthat point I think we have to be\n\n221\nrealistic. Economic nationalism\n\n222\nis not likely to go away and that doesn't\n\n223\njust affect trade although\n\n224\nthat's what we're focusing\n\n225\non the moment but it does also impact\n\n226\nglobal labour movement\n\n227\nand global capital flows and\n\n228\neconomic nationalism unfortunately I\n\n229\nthink is going to be a\n\n230\nfeature for the next 10 to 20 years\n\n231\nwhich is something we're just going to\n\n232\nhave to adapt to. Yeah I think that\n\n233\nthat's a great point\n\n234\nbecause I guess there's a lot of question\n\n235\nmarks about what maybe\n\n236\nhappens after Trump's current\n\n237\nterm and I guess question marks as to\n\n238\nwhether he might stand for another\n\n239\nelection but how do you\n\n240\nthink about the longevity of these\n\n241\npolicies in the US beyond the current\n\n242\nTrump term? Well what we've\n\n243\ngot underlying this is the very dramatic\n\n244\nstructural upheaval of the\n\n245\nglobal economy that is represented\n\n246\nby the fourth industrial revolution. What\n\n247\nthis does is encourage scapegoat\n\n248\neconomics. People feel\n\n249\nvery afraid of the future. There's a lot\n\n250\nof fear out there and when\n\n251\nyou get this people want someone\n\n252\nto blame and one of the easiest groups to\n\n253\nblame throughout history\n\n254\nis to blame the foreigner\n\n255\nwhether as immigrants or as foreign\n\n256\ncountries doesn't matter.\n\n257\nThis has been going on for\n\n258\nthousands of years blaming foreigners is\n\n259\nalways the easy option and\n\n260\nthat then fuels the economic\n\n261\nnationalism. So this is why I think\n\n262\nnationalism is going to persist. Now\n\n263\neconomics can make very\n\n264\nstrong arguments against this try and\n\n265\nrestrict it but it is going to be a\n\n266\npersistent underlying theme\n\n267\nthat ebbs and flows over time. So I think\n\n268\nwe have to be accepting of\n\n269\nthe fact that this is going to\n\n270\nbe a feature. It is also possible though\n\n271\nthat you get a reaction to the\n\n272\nnationalism you get a pushback\n\n273\nand actually Brexit is a good example of\n\n274\nthis. So when the UK left\n\n275\nthe European Union it was all\n\n276\nabout we want to control immigration and\n\n277\nso on and so forth. In the\n\n278\naftermath of that there was a\n\n279\nrealisation of the economic benefits that\n\n280\nmigrants bring to the UK and actually\n\n281\nsupport for migration\n\n282\nin the UK went up significantly in the\n\n283\naftermath of Brexit. It may\n\n284\nwell be that one of the things\n\n285\nthat comes out of this current period of\n\n286\nturmoil is you re-establish a\n\n287\nbit more popular support for\n\n288\nthe idea of free trade. The benefits of\n\n289\nfree trade become a bit\n\n290\nmore visible as US consumers\n\n291\nsuddenly discover their cost of living is\n\n292\ngoing up dramatically. That\n\n293\nmay shift their attitudes to\n\n294\nthe balance of free trade versus\n\n295\nprotectionism. So I think that economic\n\n296\nnationalism will persist\n\n297\nbut we will get some opportunities to\n\n298\nreact against it and let us hope that\n\n299\nthose will turn out to be\n\n300\nthe more dominant force over time. And\n\n301\nhow are you thinking about some of the\n\n302\ncountries or sectors\n\n303\nthat might be relative losers and\n\n304\nrelative winners out of all of this\n\n305\ndisruption? Well I mean I think\n\n306\nfairly obviously the United States is a\n\n307\nrelative loser at least for the time\n\n308\nbeing. This is a very\n\n309\naggressive tax policy on the US economy.\n\n310\nIt is something which is\n\n311\ndamaging very long established\n\n312\nbusiness networks, supply chains. There\n\n313\nis now enormous\n\n314\nuncertainty. So while President Trump\n\n315\nhas suggested companies may start to\n\n316\ninvest in plants in the\n\n317\nUnited States to make things in the\n\n318\nUnited States, I think that's very\n\n319\nunrealistic because you have\n\n320\nno certainty or security in your\n\n321\nsupply chain or labor policy or perhaps\n\n322\neven rule of law in the United\n\n323\nStates. I think companies are\n\n324\ngoing to be quite hesitant to invest. So\n\n325\nI think the US remains at a\n\n326\ndisadvantage and even as these\n\n327\npolicies are reversed that lingering\n\n328\nuncertainty and loss of trust is\n\n329\nsomething which puts the US I\n\n330\nthink at a longer term relative\n\n331\ndisadvantage. When we look at sectors\n\n332\nobviously those in sectors that\n\n333\nhave long complex supply chains are going\n\n334\nto be disadvantaged in this\n\n335\nsituation. But we shouldn't\n\n336\njust focus on the negative. There are\n\n337\ngoing to be positives as\n\n338\nwell. So there are underlying\n\n339\nlong term trends that will continue. The\n\n340\nshift towards efficiency\n\n341\nthat comes out of technology,\n\n342\nartificial intelligence, robotics,\n\n343\ndigitization, that's not\n\n344\ngoing away. The longevity of human\n\n345\nbeings, the fact that we are living for\n\n346\nlonger, that's not going\n\n347\nto go away. These are trends\n\n348\nthat I think will provide longer term\n\n349\nbenefits and they are either able to\n\n350\novercome some of the\n\n351\ncosts associated with economic\n\n352\nnationalism or of course they are\n\n353\nindependent of them and those\n\n354\nwill be areas perhaps to be focusing on.\n\n355\nThank you Paul and how can\n\n356\nclients keep in touch with your\n\n357\nlatest thinking?

Thank you.\n\nCIO Alert | Trade war: FAQ\n 7 Apr 2025\nFinancial market volatility is exceptionally high amid conflicting headlines and ongoing uncertainty about the extent and direction of tariffs.In this note we provide answers to some of the key client questions we have received:Should I sell equities now?The short answer is no. Even though the market may move even lower in the near term, periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility, stay the course, and/or put fresh money to work. On the 12 occasions since 1945 when the S\u0026P 500 fell by 20% from its peak, the index delivered positive returns 67% of the time over the subsequent year (average return 12.9%), rising to 91% over three years (average return 29.2%) and 100% over five years (average return 52.7%).Staying invested also reduces the risk of missing significant \"up days\" for financial markets, which often occur during periods of high volatility. The 7% intraday swing in the S\u0026P 500 on 7 April demonstrates the potential costs of selling at the wrong time.It’s also important to remember that the policy-induced nature of this sell-off means it is more susceptible to a rapid rebound than, for instance, a sell-off driven by purely economic factors.What could trigger further downside?A principal worry is a tit-for-tat conflict. We have seen some signs of this developing in recent days, with China announcing a 34% duty on imports from the US on Friday, and President Trump warning on Monday that if China goes ahead, the US will retaliate with an additional tariff of 50%.Robust countermeasures from the EU would also add to market fears of an escalating global trade conflict. The EU is at least expected to reveal a set of countermeasures on up to USD 28bn of US imports, in response to earlier steel and aluminum tariffs.The Trump administration could also pursue so-called Section 232 investigations into specific sectors, notably pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, which have been exempted from tariffs thus far, but could be subject to higher US duties in the future.How can I hedge my portfolio?BondsThe 10-year US Treasury yields of 4.1% are close to our year-end target, but this should still offer respectable total return potential and diversification benefits for portfolios. In a downside scenario we would expect 10-year Treasury yields to fall to 2.5%, offering potentially significant capital gains for investors.We prefer medium duration fixed income to hedge portfolios. The significant increase in 10- and 30-year yields on 7 April demonstrates that investors at the longer end of the yield curve need to remain conscious of the potential volatility that can be triggered by fears about fiscal policy, stagflation, or other countries reducing Treasury holdings.GoldGold prices sold off on both Friday and Monday, but this is not altogether surprising, as during periods of extreme market stress investors sometimes use the metal to meet margin calls.We believe the sell-off offers a good opportunity for investors looking to build exposure to an asset that we believe will continue to offer portfolio diversification benefits, particularly against downside tariff, geopolitical, or economic scenarios. In our base case we target gold prices of USD 3,200/oz.Hedge fundsWe believe hedge funds can offer valuable protection to portfolios during volatile periods. Their performance typically has a low correlation with traditional stocks and bonds, providing diversification benefits and potentially stabilizing portfolios during turbulent times.In particular, we believe hedge fund strategies like discretionary macro, equity market neutral, select relative-value, or multi-strategy can help cushion portfolios in down markets and capitalize on dislocations. We believe the alpha orientation and conservative posture of multi strategy funds will mean near-term performance is likely to be largely insulated from market volatility. Similarly, we expect that macro strategies will have generated positive outcomes amid the volatility.Capital preservationHigh levels of implied volatility mean that downside hedging is no longer cheap to implement, but it can be an effective way for investors to manage potential downside risks to portfolios that could materialize if markets begin to price a deeper US recession.Should I be concerned about alternatives?We have a cautiously optimistic view on the outlook for private market investments, albeit stressing the need for selectivity and a long-term investment horizon, amid increased recessionary risks.Private market valuations tend to follow those of public markets with a lag. So if current price weakness in public markets persists, we would expect private market valuations to adjust lower. However, we would expect the \"correction\" in private markets to be less than that for public markets, given more attractive valuations entering 2025. We also note that deploying capital in periods of stress has historically been associated with higher subsequent returns over time.In private equity, we note that sponsors are generally less exposed to trade-reliant industries than in public markets. We prefer middle market buyouts and believe this strategy could potentially benefit if the next phase of Trump’s policy agenda is focused on pro-growth policies, given the domestic nature of these businesses. Meanwhile, secondaries funds should benefit from a fresh supply of discounted deals prompted by investors seeking liquidity.In private credit, we anticipate a slowing in lending activity and some debt servicing challenges as profit growth slows, especially in more challenged segments of the market. We favor managers with a focus on sponsor-backed, upper-middle-market, and large-cap deals in sectors insulated from economic and tariff pressures.Is the dollar a safe haven anymore?The Dollar Index (DXY) is now trading lower than prior to 2 April, despite the volatility in markets. In part this is because if higher tariffs weaken the US economy, the Federal Reserve has much more room to ease monetary policy than its counterparts.In the short term, we favor using elevated levels of currency volatility to trade what we expect to be near-term ranges in key pairs, including EURUSD (centered around 1.10), USDCHF (centered around 0.86), and GBPUSD (centered around 1.31).Over the medium term, we believe a more sustained period of weakness for the US dollar is likely if the Fed cuts interest rates faster than expected in response to weakness in US economic growth. In addition, we believe that the uncertainty may lead some market participants to diversify long held and profitable USD asset exposures.To position for longer-term dollar weakness while monetizing near-term volatility, we like strategies that sell dollar upside.What might support a more sustained market recovery?Our base case is that after an initial phase in which tariffs could rise further, US effective tariff rates start to come down from Q3 as legal, business, and political pressure mounts, and as deals with individual countries and industries are struck. In this scenario, we believe the S\u0026P 500 can recover to 5,800 by year-end.Nevertheless, we believe that from current levels markets will likely require clearer evidence supporting our base case before a sustained recovery emerges.Potential catalysts could include delays, Congressional objections, court injunctions, or policy reversals from the Trump administration.Evidence that US effective tariff rates are starting to trend toward 10-15%could also stabilize markets, though so far the Trump administration has appeared to be negotiating with smaller trading partners. More meaningful moves would likely require negotiations with China and/or the EU.Shifts in the Fed's policy stance could also help establish a market bottom, particularly if the Fed prioritizes growth and financial stability concerns. Shifting Fed policy played an important role in establishing market bottoms in 2018, 2020, and 2022.Is the Fed hamstrung by the inflationary impact of tariffs?The Fed faces some constraints in its ability to manage slowing growth owing to the inflationary impact of tariffs. But we do expect the Fed to ultimately prioritize growth and financial stability if the labor market or financial market functioning weakens sufficiently. Although tariffs will initially raise US consumer prices, much weaker domestic demand is a deflationary force, which could more than offset the impact of tariffs over the medium term. Additionally, longer-term market-implied inflation expectations have moved lower in the past two weeks, which may reinforce the Fed’s likely focus on supporting growth rather than combating inflation.We expect the Fed to deliver 75-100bps of rate cuts over the remainder of 2025.Is fiscal stimulus in the US, Europe, or China a realistic offset?Fiscal stimulus measures in the US, Europe, or China are unlikely to be substantial enough to significantly offset the negative impacts of tariffs.In the US, discussions continue on reaching a budget reconciliation bill, with the Trump administration aiming to make 2017’s personal tax cuts permanent. However, even if passed, the result would be the avoidance of a negative fiscal impulse, rather than a fresh fiscal boost.Bloomberg on Monday reported that Chinese officials are discussing accelerating domestic fiscal stimulus measures, in line with our expectations. We also anticipate more support for tech innovation and self-sufficiency, and monetary easing in the form of more cuts to its RRR (100-200bps) and policy rate (30-50bps). However, at present, Chinese policy remains reactive rather than proactive.In Europe, the shift toward increased defense spending and the pro-growth shift in German policy offer longer-term support to the economic outlook. But the impact on the economy is more likely to be felt in 2026-27, therefore, not offering a short-term offset to the impact of tariff policy.Even without those, what are the levels to just \"close your eyes and buy\"?We hold a Neutral tactical stance on equities, including US, Europe, and China, and believe markets could move even lower in the very near term.However, we note that periods of market stress have historically and consistently offered long-term rewards for diversified investors who look through near-term volatility and stay the course and/or put fresh money to work.We can use historical context to better understand what is being priced at different levels, to give investors a sense of near-term risk and reward.4,915 (20% decline, bear market territory). Analyzing the 12 occasions that the S\u0026P 500 has fallen by 20% from its peak since 1945, subsequent returns have been positive returns 67% of the time over the subsequent year, with a mean return of 12.9%.4,153 (32.4% decline, consistent with an average decline during a recession). The S\u0026P 500 rallied by an average of 41% from its bear market trough over the subsequent year and an average of 97% over a five-year timespan.3,686 (40% decline, consistent with four worst recessions since 1958). The S\u0026P 500 would be trading at less than 16x “trend” earnings since 1960, consistent with levels reached in March 2020. The S\u0026P 500 surged 78% in the year following the March 2020 low.What are the opportunities amid the selling?At times of heightened uncertainty and elevated volatility, there are broadly three strategies investors can pursue:Manage volatility. For investors concerned about the near-term risks and looking to hedge portfolios against potential further downside.Take advantage of volatility. For investors unsure about the near-term but looking to utilize high levels of volatility to earn additional portfolio income.Look through volatility: For investors who were underinvested going into the sell-off and/or are willing to take on near-term risk for likely long-term reward.For investors aiming to \"look through volatility\" in the US, we have identified 20 stocks across a wide range of sectors (Communications services, consumer discretionary, energy, health care, industrials, IT, materials, real estate, and utilities). These picks are drawn from higher quality stocks with solid business models which we rate as most preferred, and whose valuations have fallen to levels we deem attractive and therefore offer what we believe is good longer-term value.Meanwhile, in Europe, our Six ways to invest in Europe theme provides a selective approach to gaining exposure to fundamental equity drivers, such as increased fiscal spending initiatives. Since 2 April, we have moved our selection to be more cyclically balanced, adding some more defensive exposure.What about long-term ideas like AI, Longevity, Power and Resources?We believe that our Transformational Innovation Opportunities of AI, Longevity, and Power and Resources are compelling over the long term, even if they are likely to face near-term volatility.The near-term outlook for AI and technology is challenged. With rules around tariffs and exemptions still not clear at a company level, we see a wide range of negative EPS impact for global tech. We expect IT companies to offer tepid outlooks at the upcoming earnings season. And hyperscalers’ investment in AI infrastructure may also be at risk if core cloud revenues decelerate.Simultaneously, we believe that the longer-term drivers remain firmly intact and that structured strategies including capital preservation strategies should be considered as ways of building longer-term exposure while managing near-term risks.LongevityTariffs pose risks to the operating margins for pharma companies. But at the same time the US health care sector may be more immune from economic concerns than more growth-sensitive sectors. We also expect updates to government health care programs, and pivotal clinical data on oral obesity drugs coming over the next few months to support stocks over our tactical investment horizon. Over the longer term, as people live longer, wealthier, and healthier lives, we anticipate a growing demand for products that extend healthy lifespans.Power and resourcesTariffs are likely to hurt many of the industrial and raw material stocks that comprise much of the electrification value chain. However, despite elevated economic uncertainty, we believe investors with medium- to long-term investment horizons may use this volatility to gradually build exposure to a robust and durable upcycle in power demand and grid infrastructure.Given the high structural demand, we believe that companies should be able to pass on at least some of the costs resulting from tariffs through to buyers. We also note that many stocks exposed to Power and Resources went from trading at sizable valuation premiums to currently trading at discounts to sector averages, despite the high likelihood that they deliver higher organic revenue growth in the years ahead.Trump's tariffs: Assessing the impact on individual countries\n 03 Apr 2025\nThe measures announced by President Trump on Wednesday, 2 April will bring the effective tariff rate on imports into the United States to the highest level in at least 100 years.In assessing the tariff impact on individual countries, it is important to consider the difference between the “headline” tariff rates and the “effective” tariff rates, once we account for exemptions. We also need to consider existing tariff rates, which the tariffs announced on 2 April generally “stack” on top of.The table below includes a breakdown of pre-2 April tariffs, “headline” announcements, adjustments for exemptions, and our estimates of the new effective tariff rate. It includes a focus on Asia. Announced tariffs on Asia went further than expected, while proving lesser-than-expected on Canada and Mexico. This could suggest that the Trump administration is pursuing a “Fortress North America” strategy, and could keep the pressure on individual European and Asian economies high.The situation remains fluid. In the near term, we believe the direction for effective tariff rates could be higher still. We believe that the EU and China are likely to retaliate, and the reciprocal approach to US tariffs means that retaliation by trading partners is likely to be met with even higher US tariffs. In addition, some of the goods excluded from US tariffs in the 2 April announcement may be subject to future Section 232 investigations, which could lead to some exclusions being removed.Nevertheless, as we look over a three- to six-month horizon, in our base case we do think that the effective tariff rate will start to gradually reduce as legal, economic, political, and business pressure mounts.In our base case we think that from around 25% today, effective US tariff rates will peak in the region of 25-30%, be on a downward trajectory by the third quarter, and end 2025 in the 10-15% range.For our full assessment of the economic and investment implications of the tariff announcements, and our latest scenarios, please see the CIO Alert and Global Risk Radar publications.Estimated tariff impact on select countries\n                Note: To calculate the effective \"reciprocal\" tariff rate based on the stated exclusions in the April 2 executive order, we excluded pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, copper, gold, steel, aluminum, steel \u0026 aluminum derivative products, autos, auto parts, energy, and rare earth products. While these products may have been excluded under IEEPA, trade investigations may yield separate additional tariffs under Section 232 or Section 301.

When we see our hard-earned dollars dwindling in value, it's natural to feel anxious about what this might mean for our families and our ability to achieve our goals. Having a clear plan can help us to weather market storms and even take advantage of volatility.Here are three reasons to be confident and calm, even during market drawdowns.1. Sell-offs are painful but short-livedWe have words to describe different levels of market declines, based on the size of the drawdown from the last all-time high. A greater-than-10% drawdown is known as a “correction,” and if the sell-off exceeds 20% it becomes a “bear market.”At the time of writing, the S\u0026P 500 is in a correction, but it's possible that this will become a bear market. For the purpose of planning, it's best to assume that we will experience a bear market so that we're prepared for the consequences.During bear markets since World War II, the S\u0026P 500 fell an average of 32% from peak to trough, and it took an average of three years before reaching a new all-time high. For investors with a diversified portfolio, losses were milder and recoveries were swifter; a 60% stock, 40% bond portfolio experienced an average bear market drawdown of 19%, staging a full recovery of these losses about two years and three months after the market peak.2. A Liquidity strategy protects against bear market damageBecause we understand bear markets, we know how to protect against them. If we do not sell during a bear market, then it will leave no lasting damage on our portfolio's ability to generate growth. A well-funded Liquidity strategy—holding enough cash, bonds, and borrowing capacity to cover spending needs for the next 3–5 years—is enough to fully insulate our day-to-day spending from market volatility.Tapping into the Liquidity strategy instead of liquidating investments at “bear market prices” can help us to avoid the risk of permanently locking in losses. With this financial cushion, we can maintain our lifestyle comfortably while we wait for markets to recover. This helps to preserve our long-term assets' ability to rebound from their losses and participate fully in the market's long-term growth potential.3. We have a plan to take advantage of market volatilityWith the Liquidity strategy to help protect us against bear market damage, we can make tactical adjustments that help us improve our portfolio's ability to participate in a market rebound. As we discuss in Five actions to help manage uncertainty, we can rebalance to “buy low and sell high”; enhance our after-tax growth potential by harvesting capital losses and/or implementing partial Roth conversions; and avoid locking in otherwise-temporary losses by tapping into borrowing strategies to create liquidity.Speak with your financial advisor about opportunities to harness heightened market volatility. For example, volatility tends to improve the risk/return profile of options strategies and structured investments, allowing you to potentially increase your portfolio's yield and/or growth potential while maintaining protection against potential losses.For more information on past market cycles, and actions that you can take to manage market volatility, please see ubs.com/bearmarketguidebook.\n Time frames may vary. Strategies are subject to individual client goals, objectives, and suitability. This approach is not a promise or guarantee that wealth, or any financial results, can or will be achieved.\nChinese economy: Macro implications of hefty US tariffs\n 03 Apr 2025\nThe US has announced additional 34% tariffs on China on top of the 20% tariff imposed earlier. We estimate that the cumulative tariffs could lead to a 200bps drop in China’s GDP growth over 2025-26.China will likely respond with more pronounced retaliatory measures on the US than the initial rounds, including tit-for-tat tariffs and non-tariff measures.Domestically, the Chinese government may roll out more measures to boost domestic demand especially consumption, while supporting tech innovation.Externally, China would seek to strengthen ties with non-US partners amid potential global supply chain reshuffling.Global risk radar: Reciprocal tariffs by the numbers\n 03 Apr 2025\nPresident Trump introduced a \"baseline\" tariff of 10% on imports from all other nations starting on 5 April, with higher \"reciprocal\" rates on specified trading partners deemed to have excessive tariff or non-tariff barriers from 9 April.The 2 April tariffs include a 34% rate on China (54% including already announced tariffs), 24% on Japan, 20% on the European Union, and 31% on Switzerland. USMCA-compliant goods (from Canada and Mexico) will be exempt for now. The President also reiterated earlier announced 25% tariffs on auto imports and parts.The Trump administration’s actions had already increased the US effective tariff rate from 2.5% to approximately 9.0%, the highest since World War II. The situation remains fluid. If the threatened sector-specific tariffs are also eventually applied, our initial estimates suggest that the effective tariff rate could rise as much as 15 percentage points to a level between 20% and 25%.The bulk of the reciprocal tariff impact is directed towards Asia, as measured by the contribution to the increase in the effective tariff rate, followed by Europe.Please download the full report for a table of summary statistics that provides an initial overview of the announced 2 April tariffs by country, with some accompanying data on US imports by country, the revenue potential based on 2024 import volumes, and the share of US imports from each country as a share of its GDP.Estimates of customs duties are based on 2024 import volumes, which will likely fall as trade activity declines as a result of the tariffs. This list does not factor in exemptions on semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and other products listed in the Executive Order.CIO Alert | Trump tariffs: Our view for investors\n 02 Apr 2025\nWhat happened?President Trump has announced a major increase in tariffs on imports into the United States.The President introduced a \"baseline\" tariff of 10% on imports from all other nations starting on 5 April, with higher \"reciprocal\" rates on specified trading partners deemed to have excessive tariff or non-tariff barriers from 9 April.The announced tariffs include a 34% rate on China (54% including already announced tariffs), 24% on Japan, 20% on the European Union, and 31% on Switzerland. USMCA compliant goods (from Canada and Mexico) will be exempt for now. The President also reiterated earlier announced 25% tariffs on auto imports.In technical documents, exemptions were made on copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, bullion, lumber articles, and energy, as well as other certain minerals not available in the United States.In his speech, President Trump revealed a principle that the US will impose a reciprocal tariff of half of the estimated tariff and non-tariff barriers imposed by trading partners on US exports. The President invited negotiations with trading partners, though specified that this would require lower tariffs or non-tariff barriers or additional inward investment into the United States.Equity market futures reacted negatively to the announcement, with S\u0026P 500 futures trading down around 3% after the speech, Nasdaq down 4%, and Russell 2000 down 5%. Bond yields edged lower, with investors seeming to focus on risks to growth rather than the inflationary impact of tariffs. At the time of writing the US two-year yield was trading 2bps lower at 3.84%, while the10-year was off 3bps at 4.13%. The USD strengthened marginally against most major currencies, though the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar initially rallied in response to the USMCA exemption. Gold traded up 0.3%.What do we think?In the weeks ahead we expect the White House’s executive authority to be challenged in the courts. The President announced the tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which hasn’t previously been utilized to announce such sweeping changes to economic policy. Furthermore, businesses are likely to intensify lobbying efforts. And political pressure to ease tariffs could mount as economic costs rise.In our base case (to which we assign a 50% probability), we would expect tariffs to be reduced from the levels announced by the President. The President himself invited negotiations, and Treasury Secretary Bessent said in a Bloomberg interview that the announced tariffs are “the high end of the number” and that countries could take steps to bring tariffs down.However, this process will likely take time. And in the near term, the principle of the US imposing \"reciprocal\" tariffs could even mean that some tariff rates increase if other countries retaliate.We expect this to mean a tariff-related slowdown in growth in the second and third quarter. The Trump administration’s actions had already increased the US effective tariff rate from 2.5% to approximately 9.0%, the highest since World War II. Our initial estimates suggest that Wednesday’s announcements would bring the effective tariff rate around 15 percentage points higher, to around 25%.Even if tariffs are ultimately reduced by year-end, the near-term shock and associated uncertainty is likely to drive a near-term slowdown in the US economy and reduce full-year 2025 growth to closer to or below 1%. We would also expect the Federal Reserve to deliver 75-100bps of rate cuts over the remainder of 2025.We note that heightened uncertainty alone has already been feeding through into weaker business and consumer sentiment. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 49 in March from 50.3 in February, the first contraction in three months, consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose by less than expected in February, and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast for Q1 growth is currently running at -1.4% (adjusted for gold imports).An upside scenario (20% probability) is that tariffs are reversed relatively quickly. Previously announced tariffs on Mexico and Canada in February were reversed in a matter of days following lobbying from businesses. Nevertheless, the political capital invested in “Liberation Day” and the breadth of the announced tariffs makes a wholesale reversal less likely on this occasion.We also note that the tone of the Trump administration’s rhetoric on tariffs had shifted to be significantly more hawkish in recent weeks. At the beginning of March, President Trump said: “There will be a little disturbance, but we’re OK with that...It won’t be much.” On 30 March, in contrast, President Donald Trump said, “I couldn’t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American cars.” He also described the auto tariffs as “permanent, 100 percent,”A downside scenario (30% probability) is that the tariffs announced today remain in place for more than three to six months or potentially increase with rounds of retaliation from trading partners. We believe this could lead to a US recession and even greater rate cuts from the Fed (c.300bps).How to invest?EquitiesThe shift to a more aggressive tariff scenario over the past week has contributed to higher volatility in equity markets.Market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus US economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs, and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down. All of this is likely to mean an extended period of volatility for US equities.Nonetheless, we do believe the market will end the year higher and continue to see strong long-term potential in our artificial intelligence, longevity, and power and resources, Transformational Innovation Opportunities, which could get caught up in near-term de-risking. Investors can also consider utilizing yield-generating strategies to benefit from current high levels of volatility.While uncertainty is currently high, we also believe that, at the margin, incremental news flow could become more supportive as we approach the second half of the year. Now that the tariffs have been announced, negotiations to soften them can begin. Tariff revenue could be used to offset the cost of extending tax cuts. And we would expect the Fed to respond to weakening growth with interest rate cuts.The announced tariffs will have a negative impact on Europe and China, and after year-to-date rallies in markets, a period of near-term de-risking is possible, particularly if retaliatory measures are announced. We hold a Neutral stance on both markets. For now, we recommend selectivity, favoring beneficiaries of increased fiscal spending and small- to mid-cap stocks in Europe, while in Asia we are drawn to Taiwan's structural growth market and defensive strategies centered on mainland China's state-owned enterprises.In the weeks ahead we will be monitoring market pullbacks in both markets for opportunities for underallocated investors to build up their exposure to underlying positive long-term drivers in both regions, with Europe likely to benefit from higher fiscal spending and China from its recent more pro-business tilt.Fixed incomeWe believe that high-quality fixed income represents an attractive portfolio diversifier. Bond yields have remained relatively high in recent weeks, in spite of recent volatility and concerns about growth. We believe this creates an opportunity for investors to seek durable portfolio income and optimize cash returns.Although the Fed is facing a challenging position, with growth likely to fall and inflation likely to rise because of the announced tariffs, we believe that evidence of labor market weakness would provoke faster Fed rate cuts. Fears that announced tariffs could prove long-lived may also contribute to lower long-term Fed rate expectations and prove supportive for quality bonds.High grade and investment grade bonds offer attractive risk-reward, in our view, and we also like diversified fixed income strategies (including senior loans and private credit) and equity income strategies.Currencies and commoditiesWe believe that investors can benefit from currency volatility by trading the range in EURUSD, USDCHF, and GBPUSD. In isolation, tariffs are dollar positive, and the US dollar has also traditionally rallied during risk-off periods. However, we believe this effect is likely to be offset by potentially sharper downgrades to US growth and rate expectations than in other regions, as well potential increases in diversification flows away from dollar assets because of the political uncertainty.We note that longer-term weakness in the USD could arise if downside risks to the growth outlook are accompanied by sharper-than-expected Fed rate cuts.Meanwhile, we expect gold, now above USD 3,000/oz, to continue serving as a hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks. We target USD 3,200/oz by year-end in our base case but note that the metal could trade even higher in the event of tariffs staying in place longer than expected.Preview of 2 April tariffs\n 31 Mar 2025\nThe US administration is poised to announce a new round of “reciprocal” tariffs on 2 April after imposing a range of tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, a separate set of tariffs on steel, aluminum, and derivative products, and newly announced levies on autos and auto parts.There is a wide range of potential outcomes related to the announced tariff rates, the sectors and countries targeted, the effective date of the tariffs, and their ultimate duration. How targeted countries respond is also highly uncertain.Who and what? The new reciprocal tariffs will likely target a range of countries (potentially focusing on Europe and Asia ex-China) and products (potentially pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber, copper) to address other countries’ persistent trade surpluses with the US and grievances related to high tariff and non-tariff barriers.How high? Recall that the tariffs imposed during Trump 1.0 were much smaller (the US effective tariff rate rose from 1.5% in 2016 to 3.0% in 2020), primarily focused on China, and followed a highly stimulative reduction in personal and corporate taxes.The 2025 tariffs are much larger than in Trump 1.0: The effective tariff rate has increased from 2.5% to approximately 9%. Wednesday’s reciprocal tariffs could push the effective tariff rate another 4 percentage points higher. Anything further could move tariffs beyond a revenue-raising “sweet spot.”How long? We do not know how long the previously enacted tariffs and any future tariffs will remain in force, but we believe peak tariff uncertainty may soon be behind us. Much of the work the administration set out to achieve will have been put in place, and there are numerous potential offramps available.Market volatility reignited by auto tariffs\n 27 Mar 2025\nThought of the dayUS stocks fell on Wednesday, as anxiety over trade returned ahead of an announcement on auto tariffs from President Donald Trump. The S\u0026P 500 fell 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 2%, reflecting the market's unease, with the Magnificent 7 heading toward its worst quarter since 2022.Despite entering correction territory earlier this month, the S\u0026P 500 has rebounded by around 3.5% in the past two weeks, aided by reports of President Trump's tempered tariff approach, which had helped to maintain market calm this week.Additionally, market sentiment may have improved owing to progress in easing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, as they reached separate agreements with the US to pause maritime attacks and develop strategies to implement a ban on strikes against energy facilities.However, stocks fell leading up to Trump's press conference, as Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President Alberto Musalem cautioned that inflation might continue to exceed the central bank's 2% target owing to tariff changes, and EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič warned that the anticipated US tariffs could be as high as 20%, affecting all member states equally.During Wednesday's press conference, President Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles, light trucks, and key auto parts, effective 2 April. An accompanying factsheet claims the 25% tariff will eventually be applied to the non-US content of USMCA-compliant auto production, once a process is established to do so. Shares in the big three US automakers fell 4-8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, while Japanese and South Korean automakers fell 2-4% on Thursday. S\u0026P futures are indicating a 0.1% rise when the US market reopens on Thursday.What do we think?While recent media reports have suggested the upcoming reciprocal tariff announcement on 2 April, dubbed “Liberation Day” by Trump, may not be as severe as initially feared, we think market volatility could pick up again following the latest automotive sector tariff headlines. Trump claimed the latest tariffs would foster growth in the automotive industry by encouraging companies to establish more factories in the US. While some domestic plants may have space to modestly lift capacity, this is limited in scope against the context of the roughly 16mn new vehicles sold in the US annually. Building and bringing new auto production facilities online in the US takes close to three years, limiting the medium-term ability of the US domestic supply chain to ramp up production.We think the proposed tariffs as announced would deliver a big hit to the auto industry, stoking higher costs, higher prices, and a sharp decline in US sales. The tariffs could also disrupt supply chains, deter investments, and significantly raise consumer prices. They may also ignite trade disputes with Europe, Japan, and South Korea. In terms of the broader impact, although the US auto sector, excluding Tesla, accounts for only 0.25% of the US market, the bigger question is what these very aggressive automotive tariffs signal for next week’s announcement on both reciprocal and ex-auto sector tariffs. We believe bilateral deals can be reached to mitigate the breadth and scale of the coming tariffs on 2 April, with EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič meeting US trade officials, India expressing openness to cutting tariffs on US imports, and Vietnam proposing preferential tariff cuts. However, investors will also need to consider the risk of a sharper response from US trade partners affected by this action. We advise investors to prepare for a wide range of selective tariffs and retaliatory measures that could increase market swings.The geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, while showing signs of easing, remain a factor weighing on market sentiment. The ambiguity in the maritime ceasefire terms suggests geopolitical risks are likely to linger, with Russia demanding conditions for the Black Sea agreements to take effect, while Ukraine insists the truce should proceed without sanctions relief. Our base case remains that a full ceasefire is unlikely to be reached imminently.US consumer confidence slid further amid a poor economic outlook, marking the lowest level in over four years. Households are concerned about higher prices and a downbeat economic outlook, as indicated by the Conference Board survey and the University of Michigan's sentiment reading. Additionally, credit card issuer Synchrony reported that US consumers are curbing spending, with higher delinquencies in auto loans, credit cards, and home credit lines suggesting financial strains. Although our economic forecast does not call for a recession, poor sentiment amid elevated uncertainty is likely to weigh on market performance in the near term.In light of the current market volatility and uncertainty surrounding trade policies, investors may find opportunities in equity exposure. Our analysis suggests that buying the S\u0026P 500 after a 10% drawdown can potentially yield higher returns compared to waiting for larger declines. Historical performance, while not a guarantee of future results, indicates that waiting for more significant drawdowns risks missing out on rapid market recoveries. Our back-testing analysis of the S\u0026P 500 since 1990 supports this strategy, showing that increasing equity exposure after a 10% correction has historically delivered the highest return and Sharpe ratio, which measures the risk-adjusted returns of a portfolio, compared to those waiting for a 15% or 20% drop. Although losses can be substantial at a -10% entry, they have typically been offset by periods of swift equity rebounds.The threat of further tariff escalation remains a key concern, but our economic forecasts do not call for a recession in the US. In our base case, a wide range of selective tariffs and counteractions are likely to lead to slower economic growth compared to last year, but they should not prevent the US economy from expanding by around 2%—its historical trend rate—this year.How do we invest?Our core message remains to stay invested in stocks. We expect a period of further stock market volatility in April. In the coming weeks, we would view levels in the S\u0026P 500 starting at a peak-to-trough drawdown of -10% as a potential buying opportunity. Investors should ensure portfolios are well diversified with assets such as quality bonds, gold, and alternatives to effectively navigate current challenges.Navigate political risks. Tariff-related uncertainty and trade policy shifts reinforce the need for portfolio diversification and risk management. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage downside risks. We continue to favor high-quality fixed income like investment grade corporate bonds, which may provide a hedge against trade risks.More to go in stocks. In our base case, we expect US equities to end the year meaningfully higher than current levels. US policy uncertainty could lead to short-term volatility, but we believe that continued structural AI tailwinds and solid earnings growth should drive markets higher once policy uncertainty peaks. Our “Six ways to invest in Europe” theme focuses on a selection of stocks exposed to positive European drivers (like pro-growth reforms in Germany or rising security investments), while also seeking to minimize exposure to tariff risks. Our stock selection has higher allocations to the industrials, materials, real estate, and utilities sectors compared to MSCI Europe.

Although economic and policy uncertainty are likely to contribute to near-term volatility, we continue to see broad-based long-term investment opportunities across the value chain, particularly in AI infrastructure names with strong pricing power and in megacap platform beneficiaries. Near-term volatility should present an opportunity to build strategic, long-term AI exposure.UBS Trending: Will tariffs reshape the US economy?\n 17 Mar 2025\nWhile headlines focus on tariffs and trade tensions, there is another aspect to the story: reshoring.

It's good to have you back in the studio.\n\nAnthony thanks for having me on the show today. Yeah. Thank you.\n\nI and I read your recent report on tariffs and reshoring.\n\nBoy, the timing of getting you in here\n\ncouldn't have been any better.\n\nWe're, you know, where we're sitting right now.\n\nThe markets are very volatile.\n\nThere's a lot of uncertainty around the tariffs\n\nbecause they go on, they come off, there's new dates.\n\nSo we won't get into the specifics\n\nbecause it can change at a moment's notice.\n\nBut I thought maybe I could just sort of say to you\n\nto kick off this conversation and the research you're doing,\n\nthe reshoring aspect is really interesting,\n\nbringing us manufacturing production back here on American soil.\n\nHow have the tariffs and the reshoring\n\nconnections and discussions been going?\n\nWell, it's a very good question, and it's a very timely question.\n\nAnd what we see is underlying Trump's tariff\n\nagenda is a focus on Made in America, America First.\n\nAnd at the heart of that, that means bringing jobs,\n\nmanufacturing innovation, investment back to American soil,\n\nnot to our neighbors in the North or our neighbors in the South,\n\nbut back to the US. Right.\n\nAnd what that really leads to is a acceleration\n\nin reshoring announcements, reshoring activity\n\nand frankly, reshoring prospects.\n\nAnd we've really seen that just in the number of job\n\nannouncements over the past year already,\n\njust as the step up is, is immense.\n\nNow, this is not something that just started last quarter.\n\nThis has been going on for a number of years.\n\nWe see reshoring under the guise of a bigger trend\n\nalso known as D globalization, where we see\n\ngrowing fracture ization between countries,\n\nwhich makes trade more expensive, which makes trade more complex\n\nand frankly, is leading companies to say\n\nit may be more expensive to produce at home today,\n\nbut it's more secure.\n\nAnd ultimately I have less and less uncertainty.\n\nI'd rather take that de-risk my supply chain,\n\neven if it comes at a slightly higher financial cost.\n\nI think many of us can remember that during the pandemic\n\nand the really the heart of the pandemic,\n\nthe supply chain issues were really prevalent.\n\nI mean, that's why the shelves in so many grocery stores\n\nfor everyday consumer goods were empty.\n\nThese tankers were stuck offshore.\n\nObviously, that would not be an issue if we were creating\n\nmost of our goods and services here in the, in the United States.\n\nSo give us an example then of where you see\n\npotential reshoring opportunities.\n\nIn the US.\n\nWe were just talking about\n\nthings like semiconductors,\n\nwhere outside the US is\n\nwhere most of them are made very few here,\n\nbut it seems like there's momentum kind of building.\n\nSo we see reshoring expanding to a wider array of industries.\n\nBut clearly the administration is focused on\n\nsome of the more strategic and sensitive and sensitive industries\n\nfor us.\n\nAnd one of those include semiconductors.\n\nTSMC already opened a massive $40 billion plant\n\nin Arizona last year, which again was after 2 or 3 years of work.\n\nThese are big commitments.\n\nYou don't turn on a big reshoring project overnight.\n\nYou're making commitments for decades,\n\nwhich ultimately take a number of years to bring online.\n\nSo we've started to see it in in areas like base\n\nmanufacturing, advanced manufacturing, defense manufacturing.\n\nWe're starting to see it in pharmaceuticals.\n\nWe're starting to see it in parts of just consumer.\n\nSo I think in general, what we're seeing\n\nis that the number of industries\n\nwhere reshoring is playing a role is growing.\n\nUnder Trump, reshoring is a mandate.\n\nUnder Biden, it was a choice.\n\nAnd as it now moves from being an option to being a mandate,\n\ncompanies are getting on the front foot about reshoring\n\nin terms of their announcements,\n\nin terms of the capital requirements and also the speed\n\nwith which are looking to onshore production.\n\nAnd we've seen several major announcements in the last month\n\nalone of companies announcing big multi-year products.\n\nSo if you look, for example, the Apple factory announcement,\n\nwhich happened two weeks ago, that's a big, big commitment.\n\nIt's multiyear. It's big dollars.\n\nAnd frankly, that's a real commitment.\n\nWe're going to move production\n\naway from China, even away from India.\n\nBack to us. Yeah.\n\nWith the question.\n\nI think that comes up for a lot of folks in.\n\nWe're learning more and more about tariffs, about how it impacts\n\nnot only the country that's\n\nexporting their goods,\n\nbut also the consumer that's paying on the other end.\n\nWhat about the long and, you know, so I would say short and long\n\nterm impacts of tariffs and then reshoring\n\nbecause obviously labor here\n\nis going to be a little bit more expensive than overseas.\n\nSo how does that play into\n\nhow you think about the long term impacts.\n\nSo I think undeniably\n\nwhen you relocate supply chains that leads to volatility\n\nand uncertainty,\n\nwhich will have\n\nshort term economic impacts, which could be somewhat,\n\nyou know, concerning or potentially somewhat volatile.\n\nBut if we look beyond the initial short term,\n\nI think by the mid term companies will have much better\n\nvisibility and security over their supply chains.\n\nAnd also as we see\n\ninflation pick up, which is inevitable in the short term.\n\nWe actually think that some of the cost differences\n\nacross arbitrage is why people offshored 20 years ago\n\nare only going to narrow.\n\nSo as supply chain security goes up,\n\nfinancial arbitrage goes down.\n\nI think it becomes a much clearer, a much easier choice.\n\nBut undeniably there will be, volatility\n\nand friction in that transition phase.\n\nAnd I think it's inevitable\n\nthat the government will see inflation pick up at some point\n\nin the near future in response to some of these tariff announces.\n\nBut those actual tariffs coming in. Yeah.\n\nYou know,\n\nwe've got an interesting chart\n\nthat you provided for us\n\ntalking about that when China, entered the World\n\nTrade Organization in the late 90s,\n\nyou did see industrial production\n\nkind of stall out a little bit here in the US,\n\nand I could imagine that that's where a lot of this research\n\nthat you are doing\n\nat Tema with your team is coming from when you look at the impact\n\nof what happens when we're not maybe\n\ngetting so many goods from China,\n\nwe're getting them more from here. Correct.\n\nSo we spend a lot of time\n\nreally looking at the implications of reshoring the,\n\nyou know, signs of reshoring, but also like how reshoring\n\nis manifesting\n\nitself across\n\ndifferent supply chains, different industries in different ways.\n\nAnd I think tariffs is one of the latest catalysts\n\nor one of the latest accelerants,\n\nbut it's by no means the only catalyst or accelerant.\n\nThis trend has been going on for a number of years.\n\nAnd that we've seen this chart\n\nis that there was a period of time when, frankly,\n\nthe industrial complex in the US was under invested in,\n\nand productivity and output, frankly, didn't accelerate.\n\nBut I think we now are seeing in a year a rapid acceleration\n\nin both investments inputs, but also outputs productivity.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd we think that's going to accelerate and continue.\n\nAnd again, this is really under\n\nthe guise of this is a focus on made in America America.\n\nFirst let's protect ourselves protect our consumers,\n\nprotect our supply chains.\n\nAnd we're looking even at these.\n\nYou mentioned some of them, these mega project announcements\n\nthat in the first quarter of 2023,\n\nyou were looking at about a $600 billion price tag.\n\nIt's all the way from fourth quarter of last year, $1.7 billion.\n\nIt's a it's a huge increase.\n\nAnd I'm imagining that number is just going to keep going higher.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo we kind of see it accelerating.\n\nJust in the first quarter of this year.\n\nAnd I think you see a number of companies that realize, you know,\n\nthey're not going to second\n\nguess what tariffs will come for how long or what race.\n\nThere's a listen.\n\nWe're going to make a commitment back\n\nto us irrespective of what happens in tariffs.\n\nBecause I think two rounds\n\nis that what we know is tariffs will come.\n\nWe don't know is with what speed, with what size\n\nand how there will be applied relatively between countries.\n\nI think it's clear that some countries\n\nthat are in the early phases of this policy have had\n\nmore of a focus in the tariff policy,\n\nbut we wouldn't\n\nbe surprised to see\n\ntariffs brought into more industries\n\nand more countries in the coming months.\n\nWhat a it's a very compelling story.\n\nSo just to wrap it up with you more,\n\nyou mentioned Made in America right at the top of the show.\n\nHow does that sync up with reshoring and tariffs.\n\nYeah, I mean Made in\n\nAmerica is really focusing\n\non, you know, investing and producing and manufacturing locally.\n\nAnd ultimately reshoring is one of the biggest drivers\n\nwill bring back manufacturing to Made in America.\n\nRight. And globalization as you see globalization.\n\nSo globalization I think thinks about the risks associated\n\nwith your manufacturing outside of your home country.\n\nI think made in America is incentives that are provided\n\nby the government or privatization\n\nto bring manufacturing back home.\n\nAnd I think we've seen some acts in the past few years\n\nthat came and went.\n\nBut it's interesting,\n\nsome of the acts that are now currently under review,\n\nthe majority, the money's actually already been spent.\n\nAnd ironically, the Chips acts as an example.\n\nThe majority of money was actually spent in red states.\n\nSo we are not worried about\n\nwhether the Chips act could or may not be repealed.\n\nWe think there will be an act that follows,\n\neven if it's a slightly different act.\n\nWhat's clear is that the government is very strategic,\n\nbut also is very focused on enabling\n\ncompanies and investors to come back to this country.\n\nRight.\n\nAs you said, the the short term impacts are there.\n\nThere will be some volatility\n\nand a lot of the uncertainty that the market really doesn't like.\n\nBut hopefully\n\nin the long term,\n\nwe'll start to see the benefits of what's happening.\n\nAnd then things might try and calm down a little bit.\n\nI think people are accepting short term volatility for midterm.\n\nSecurity, right. Actually.\n\nAnd I think that's the kind of trade off that people are.\n\nThe government is accepting.\n\nAnd I think the government is pressuring companies\n\nto accept those. Sure. Exactly.\n\nWe also have a we have a terrific Made in America report\n\nthat our chief investment office has done a lot of research on.\n\nI'm sure it probably matches a lot of what you and your team\n\nhave also seen in, in your digging through some of the numbers\n\nand the strategies and the research that goes along with\n\nwith that program. Yeah.\n\nSo we released a report last month about tariffs and reshoring,\n\nand we're actually\n\nreleasing a report this week about powering Made in America.\n\nSo what are the resources?\n\nWhat are the policies\n\nrequired to really enable\n\nthe Made in America focus from the current government? Excellent.\n\nSo yeah, we really focus a lot of bottom up research\n\nand research in the field with experts, including our own team.\n\nTerrific. More so thank you so much.\n\nGreat discussion. Very timely.\n\nLots to look forward to over the next couple of months\n\ninto the next year or so.\n\nGlad you could drop by. Good to see you.\n\nThanks for joining me. Of course.

This is the day the Trump administration will decide upon which countries to impose the next wave of tariffs. Dubbed “reciprocal tariffs,” the US president is justifying his actions as just a way of equalizing the tariffs charged on US exports and imports into various countries. When it comes to the EU, the question of cars is always mentioned: Who hasn’t heard by now that a 2.5% tariff is charged on cars sent to the US from the EU, but coming the other way the tariff is 10%. Lost in the discussion is the fact that the US charges a 25% tariff on the import of pick-up trucks.What could reciprocal tariffs look like? Despite the claims, the reality is that the existing tariffs on EU-US trade are extremely low. It is hard to get a precise estimate on the number, but the EU believes that the effective tariff rate is around 1%.1 Some estimates put the number as high as 3%, but even this is a very small figure. Thus, in theory, if reciprocal tariffs are put in place—by both sides—it would be hard to imagine that the effective tariff rate could be that far from 5%.This may well end up as the effective tariff rate post 2 April. If so, while this would harm EU exports, we do not see it as catastrophic nor having a meaningful impact on economic growth. However, in these highly uncertain times during which tariff policy seems to change every day, we need to be alert to the possibility that tariffs may be heading a lot higher. Already there has been talk of taking into account the VAT that is charged on US goods sold in Europe (the fact that this is also charged on domestic goods seems to be glossed over). How to account for perceived tax discrepancies is hard to know. And then there is the issue of non-tariff barriers, which are, even at the best of times, almost impossible to estimate to any degree of certainty. The likely solution? Perhaps rather than go through the details, the US administration may prefer to opt for a large, simple number—say, 25%?If such an increase in tariffs were to be announced and, crucially, sustained, the economic impact would likely be larger. If we assume that the US administration follows the pattern of previous tariff announcements, making them large and focused on important sectors, the effective tariff rate would be less than 25%. Knowing which sectors are deemed important to the US administration is a question only it can answer. However, given that President Trump’s initial gripe with EU trade seems to be focused on the trade surplus the bloc enjoys, and if we assume that the sectors that enjoy the largest surpluses (machinery, transport, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, to name a few) are the main focus, it is not unreasonable to expect a 25% tariff applied to these goods would lift the effective tariff rate on EU exports to the US to around 15%.The European Union has been clear that in the event of US tariffs it would react “firmly and immediately.”2 The EU’s countermeasures to the announcement of steel and aluminum tariffs by the US, scheduled to become effective on 1 April, are a clear indication of the willingness to act.3 Thus, to understand the impact of tariffs, it seems fairly safe to assume that the EU would impose an effective tariff rate on US imports of a similar magnitude.As for how long any tariffs could last, again this is hard to know as it will depend on a number of factors. However, we would caution that when it comes to EU-US trade, the “off-ramps” are not as obvious as they are for other regions that are being hit with tariffs. For example, with China, Mexico, and to a lesser extent Canada, a transactional approach to negotiations seems more likely. For Europe, the US administration is not only focused on the trade surplus: European governments’ underspending on defense, its Digital Services Tax, fines and regulations on US technology companies, as well as low corporate tax rates in some countries that encourage US companies to book profits in them denying the US of crucial tax revenue, are just some of the many issues that can get in the way of an agreement. Given these challenges, it is arguably fair to assume that if tariffs and counter-tariffs rise, they may remain in place for some time.Our modeling estimates that such an outcome (effective tariffs of 15% on imports and exports) would have a larger impact on growth than inflation in the Eurozone. It would probably not be enough to send the Eurozone into a recession this year, but it could easily halve the expected growth rate of around 1% for this year. For 2026, the impact would be less as the economy adjusts but would likely still be enough to keep growth below trend, even when the recently announced fiscal expansion (see \"Europe’s fiscal moment,\" 5 March 2025) is taken into account.As for inflation, our modeling suggests that weaker demand for Eurozone exports, the impact this would have on the labor market, and the hit to consumer confidence more widely, would likely have a disinflationary impact overall. This supports our view that the risks to the outlook for ECB rates remain to the downside; the 2% floor for the deposit rate, which we expect to be reached by June, might not hold.It should be emphasized that when trying to understand the impact of trade tariffs, there are many grey areas to consider. As has been seen in recent days, there is little predictability about what particular concern will capture President Trump’s attention. But beyond tariff rates, which country, and what products, the impact that such a volatile policy backdrop could have on consumer and business uncertainty is significant. We see the uncertainty channel, by far, as having the largest impact on the economy. Consumer spending falling and firms curtailing investment may happen even if tariffs are eventually avoided.For investors, this underscores the importance of staying invested to benefit from the medium-term upside we still see in stocks, but it is important to think about hedging equity exposures to manage some of the near-term risks.1https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_25_5412https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_25_5153https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_740CIO Alert: Equities fall as investors question \"Trump put\"\n 10 Mar 2025\nThought of the dayWhat happened?The S\u0026P 500 fell 2.7% on Monday, as markets reacted to signs that the Trump administration could be willing to tolerate a temporary “disturbance” to economic activity and higher inflation in pursuit of its economic agenda. Concerning the risks of an economic contraction, President Trump suggested the nation could face a “period of transition.” Asked whether higher US tariffs could lead to higher inflation, he said “you may get it.”Monday’s decline in the S\u0026P 500 follows a 3.1% fall last week, the largest decline in six months. The index has now given up a nearly 8% rally following Trump’s reelection on 4 November, which had kindled hopes that business would benefit from deregulation and looser fiscal policy.What’s the context?We note that while the moves in the S\u0026P 500 have been dramatic, swings in other market segments have been more muted. For example, the equal-weighted version of the S\u0026P 500 is flat for the year, the Russell 1000 value benchmark is up slightly, and high yield spreads have not widened very much.Our takeaway is that the sell-off has been exacerbated by the unwinding of extended positioning in certain market segments such as momentum and tech stocks and is not necessarily a signal that US economic risks have escalated significantly.Of course, signs that consumer and business confidence are weakening are not helping sentiment, and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index of business activity, consumer sentiment, and consumer spending data have all been weaker than expected. Meanwhile, markets are questioning the notion that the Trump administration would adapt policies in response to equity market volatility or economic growth concerns.Investor nerves are also likely being added to by the potential for a US government shutdown this weekend, and more headlines about “reciprocal” tariffs coming out on 2 April.Our updated scenariosWe are updating our House View scenarios to reflect recent developments. Our combined downside scenario of a stagflationary or cyclical downturn is now 30%, compared to the 20% chance we assign to our upside scenario.In our base case, to which we attach a 50% probability, US economic growth is likely to moderate compared with last year but remain positive. While we treat the economic data and the words of the Trump administration seriously, enacting and sustaining policies which contribute to a potentially protracted slowdown in the US economy in hope of better growth or economic dynamics in the medium to long term would require a shift from an approach which has so far focused on achieving quick success.How do we invest?In our Monthly Letter we highlighted our core message of staying invested but also hedging equity exposures to manage near-term risks. Over the coming weeks we expect further volatility and potential weakness in equity markets, and so hedging the downside remains key.At the same time, we maintain an Attractive outlook on equities based on our year-end targets and expect the S\u0026P 500 to rise to 6,600 by the end of 2025. Our base case remains that the Trump administration’s aggressive stance on trade will weigh on growth, but not so much as to drive the US into recession. We also expect ongoing structural AI advancements.In short, while we see medium-term upside for stocks, investors will need to navigate political risks in the months ahead. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage downside risks. We like high-quality fixed income like investment grade corporate bonds, which may provide a hedge against trade risks, and long USDCNY positions could serve as a trade hedge. And we continue to believe gold remains an effective portfolio hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks, while certain hedge fund strategies can improve portfolio resilience.We also make a number of adjustments to our equity recommendations to account for the latest developments.We downgrade Asia ex-Japan equities from Attractive to Neutral after year-to-date performance of 5%. Asian equities have been supported by healthy fundamentals, including expansionary regional PMIs and expectations of high-single-digit earnings growth in 2025. However, tariff uncertainty has intensified, which could weigh on Asia’s export cycle, and signs of a slowdown in US economic indicators could further weaken Asia growth expectations. Given this uncertainty, the risk premium for Asian equities is likely to rise, limiting near-term upside. The 12- month forward P/E for MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index stands at 13.5x, slightly above historical levels, and does not fully reflect tariff risks.We also downgrade China technology from Attractive to Neutral, after year-to-date performance of 32%. Chinese tech stocks have rallied strongly, driven by enthusiasm around the recent Chinese AI successes and the National People’s Congress special emphasis on AI development. However, following the rally, we no longer believe that markets underappreciate the potential for China internet stocks, and we believe further tariff escalation between the US and China is likely as structural concerns remain unaddressed. As such, we recommend tactically booking profits and waiting for greater clarity on tariffs or lower re-entry levels. We retain a neutral stance on broader China equities.In December we flagged that more pro-growth policies following the German election, a peace deal with Ukraine, and a cyclical recovery in manufacturing could support the German equity market. Although last week’s German fiscal announcement leaves Europe better placed fundamentally, in the near term, market expectations around each of the positive surprises for our tactical call have largely played out, and upcoming news flow around tariffs and economic growth uncertainty are near-term risks. So with the DAX index up close to 14% year-to-date, we close our tactical recommendation to invest in the DAX via structured solutions. We prefer selective exposure to Europe via our “Six ways to invest in Europe” theme.Trade war fears spark volatility\n 05 Mar 2025\nThought of the dayWhat happened?US stocks fell further in volatile trade on Tuesday, following the imposition of new US tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China.The S\u0026P 500 fell as much as 2% intra-day but recovered to close 1.2% lower on the day, erasing all the gains made since November’s US election. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.4% with NVIDIA recouping part of Monday’s sharp losses to finish 1.7% higher.Fresh 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada came into effect after midnight on Monday, while tariffs on China were raised by another 10%, bringing the effective tax rate to around 30%. This action was justified by border and narcotics-related issues. President Trump also said that a separate order for reciprocal tariffs would come into effect on 2 April.Canada retaliated with a 25% tariff on CAD 30bn of US imports, which will be extended to cover a further CAD 125bn of US imports in 21 days if no resolution is reached. China enacted a 10-15% tariff, effective 10 March, targeting a raft of US agricultural products ranging from beef and pork to dairy, fruit, and grains. It also imposed new restrictions on American companies and filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization. Mexico is expected to announce its response on Sunday.The VIX volatility index climbed further to 23.5 on Tuesday, gold prices rallied 0.8%, and global equities fell, with Europe’s DAX sliding 3.5% as automakers came under pressure. The Mexican peso weakened while the Canadian dollar rebounded, with traders seemingly skeptical that the new tariffs will be long-lasting. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose 7 basis points to 4.24%, while agricultural commodities—including cotton, corn, soybeans, and wheat—fell as China’s retaliatory measures targeted US farmers.After the US market closed, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested there was scope for the Trump administration to meet Canada and Mexico \"in the middle\" on tariffs, with the potential for further announcements on Wednesday. S\u0026P 500 futures pointed to a rebound on Wednesday, with a 0.6% rise at the time of writing.What do we think?Our base case assigns a 50% probability to aggressive selective tariffs but no universal tariffs by year-end. Efforts to protect US technology and limit transshipment may include rules of origin legislation to prevent tariff circumvention on Chinese goods. We also expect the use of section 301 to levy select tariffs on a wide range of EU imports with reciprocal retaliation targeting subsidies and trade imbalances, while tariffs on Canada and Mexico are likely to be rolled back at least in part. Markets will be watching for any shifts toward broader enforcement, as a full-scale tariff escalation would raise inflation risks and weigh on equities.Concerns about AI have impacted tech and AI supply chains. Reports suggest NVIDIA may reduce orders from TSMC and could face probes for potential US tech export control breaches. This adds to uncertainty from DeepSeek's entry, NVIDIA's margin pressures, and Big 4 data center demand doubts. Despite these issues, the broader AI industry remains on a solid footing, in our view, with demand for AI compute continuing to accelerate. Big 4 capex remains strong, with AI spending projected to reach USD 500bn by 2026. Big tech companies also recently flagged capacity constraints as the main impediment to cloud revenue growth, not insufficient demand. Taking a sector level view, our preferred AI names have an average 2025 free cash flow margin estimate of 29%, nearly triple that of the MSCI All Country World Index. Tech’s 2025 earnings outlook also looks robust, with Big 6 and global tech earnings growth estimates at 26% and 19%, respectively.Tariffs complicate the Federal Reserve’s path to monetary easing. Fed funds futures markets are now pricing in three 25-basis-point rate cuts for 2025, up from two before the tariffs were enacted, as markets assess the economic impact of rising trade barriers. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for 1Q growth has fallen sharply to -2.8% from +2.3% previously, with net exports subtracting 3.6 percentage points from GDP. However, we view the drop in the GDPNow estimate as more noise than signal. The spike in imports appears to be driven by physical gold inflows, which should not materially impact GDP. Consensus estimates for 1Q growth remain around 1.5%, slightly below previous estimates. The bigger concern is the downside risk to economic momentum posed by this new set of tariffs. While the Fed may look through the inflationary impact of tariffs as a one-time price shock, it could still be difficult to resume rate cuts unless the labor market data start showing weakness.How do we invest?Navigate political risks. With Canada, Mexico, and China now retaliating, trade tensions have escalated, increasing inflation risks and market volatility. Tariff-related uncertainty and trade policy shifts reinforce the need for portfolio diversification and risk management. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage downside risks, while mean-reversion strategies could be an effective way to harness increased volatility. We continue to favor high grade and investment grade bonds, which can provide insulation against trade risks. Additionally, long USDCNY positions could hedge trade-related risks, while CAD and MXN exposure should be hedged or avoided in the near term. Gold remains an effective hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks, in our view, and certain hedge fund strategies may offer resilience in volatile markets.More to go in stocks. While AI concerns have weighed on tech stocks, strong demand for AI compute and continued investment in infrastructure should support long-term growth. AI-driven capex trends reinforce our confidence in AI as a structural growth driver despite near-term volatility. Without taking any single-name views, while market sentiment remains sensitive to AI demand trends and tariff risks, we believe that earnings growth, AI investments, and economic stability should continue to support stocks.So, while volatility may persist, we continue to see room for gains in equities, supported by resilient earnings, AI-driven tailwinds, and monetary policy easing. Inflation continues to moderate, Fed policy remains accommodative, and corporate earnings have been solid, reinforcing our view that the S\u0026P 500 can reach 6,600 by year-end.Caught our attentionGermany's chancellor-in-waiting announces plans for a major boost in defense and infrastructure spending. Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alliance won Germany's recent election, has said his nation would do “whatever it takes” to fend off “threats to freedom and peace” in Europe, echoing then ECB President Mario Draghi's promise in 2012 to defend the Eurozone during the debt crisis. Merz, who is in talks to form a coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), plans to recall parliament to seek approval to free up funds of EUR 500bn for infrastructure spending and exempt defense spending over 1% of GDP from the “debt brake,” a rule introduced in 2009 to cap the government's structural budget deficit at 0.35% of GDP. In addition, the proposal would extend the deficit allowance of 0.35% of GDP to German states (Länder), which currently must run a balanced budget, potentially doubling the government’s borrowing cap to 0.7% of GDP per year.The plan led to the swiftest one-day sell-off in German government debt since 2020, with the yield on the 10-year German Bund rising around 20 basis points. The news follows comments from Merz, following his party's win in the election on 23 February, that Europe need to ensure “independence” from the US after signals that the Trump administration seems “largely indifferent” to Europe's fate. This week, he said that “additional spending on defense can only be coped with if our economy returns to stable growth within a very short period of time... This requires rapid and sustainable investments in our infrastructure.” The German announcement also comes as the European Commission announced plans for an EUR 800bn defense package. At the time of writing, Germany's DAX equity index is up 3.5% on Wednesday, reversing Tuesday's decline and taking its year-to-date gain to 16%, making it one of the best performing markets in the world in 2025. The euro is up 0.9% against the US dollar to 1.07. And the yield on the 10-year German Bund is up to 2.65% from 2.44% at the start of the week.Our view: The statement from Merz is clearly a positive development for the German and Eurozone economies. If this package passes, government spending could increase by around a cumulative 20% of GDP over the coming decade. It would also be the biggest fiscal shift in 80 years, surpassing even spending related to the reunification of Germany in the 1990s. Although spending could only start to filter through into the German economy in 2026 given inevitable lags, the boost to both business and consumer confidence could come sooner. Assuming German lawmakers approve the proposed bill, extra spending from Europe’s largest economy could improve the outlook for Eurozone assets and the euro. We keep a Neutral view on Eurozone equities overall given the region’s relatively modest earnings growth outlook, lower AI exposure, and ongoing tariff risks. But a pro-growth shift following the German election results or a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine that lowers gas prices could boost sentiment. We recommend that investors position for potential positive catalysts in Europe via structured strategies on the German DAX index, or through individual stocks that are well positioned to benefit from these themes (see “Six ways to invest in Europe” for more).China National People's Congress (NPC) offers first look at stimulus playbook. China’s top policymakers in Beijing on Wednesday revealed an official economic growth target largely unchanged at “around 5%,” despite growth challenges and escalating Trump administration tariffs. The annual “Two Sessions” meeting did offer a bigger budget deficit target of 4% of GDP, a full percentage point higher than last year, alongside CNY 1.8tr of special central government bond issuance and a plan for a special local government bond quota of CNY 4.4tr, confirming a more expansionary fiscal policy. The total size of the fiscal package announced is around CNY 3tr in new government debt (or ~2% of GDP), falling within the mid-range of market expectations and affirming a reactive approach to cope with internal and external headwinds. In delivering the opening “work report,” Premier Li Qiang also detailed stronger legal protections and policy support for private enterprises. The broader NPC meeting, which will last about a week, will see the government outline its policy roadmap for the year. The Hang Seng index rose 2.8% on Wednesday, while its China enterprises subindex gained 3.1%.Our view: The official GDP target appears aimed at anchoring market expectations. We currently expect GDP growth to slow to the mid-4% range this year, down modestly from the 5% pace in 2024. With US tariff outcomes still unclear, we think Beijing may incrementally ramp up policy support if harsher tariffs materialize and impact economic data. The commentary on private markets offers further confirmation that the private sector tech regulatory cycle has ended. The work report also pledges support for the consumption, high-tech, and advanced manufacturing sectors, and pledges to further open up the economy. Li's comments on monetary policy confirm a moderately loose outlook, with more rate cuts as appropriate. We expect banks’ reserve requirement ratio to be cut by 50-100 basis points (bps), while the policy rate could be cut by 20-40bps. The People's Bank of China has also signaled its determination to keep the yuan relatively stable into a period of heightened tariff risk. With policy stimulus largely in line with expectations and tariff risks still looming, we continue to recommend a selective approach within China equities. Our focus remains on tech, which should benefit from both strong fundamentals and Li’s reinforcement of strong legal protection for private enterprises.Ukraine – Oval Office meeting reverberates\n 04 Mar 2025\nLast week’s rupture in the relationship between the US and Ukraine reinforced worries over the magnitude and duration of US support for the war-torn country. These concerns were then validated yesterday after the US suspended military aid to Ukraine. Members of the US administration had already excluded NATO membership and significant US security guarantees for Ukraine in recent weeks. As laid out in “Markets position for possible ceasefire in Ukraine” (13 February), we expect a ceasefire to be reached this year—but only after a drawn-out negotiation process given the lack of trust and distance between desired outcomes.The latest developments increase the likelihood that Ukraine has to accept a ceasefire from a position of weakness and forced to accept terms more aligned with Russian interests. Russia, meanwhile, likely feels little pressure to come to a quick ceasefire agreement amid continued incremental territorial gains on the battlefield and fraying unity of Ukraine’s allies. US-Russian relations have improved under the Trump administration, and Russia will likely look for sanctions removal and renewed business dealings with the US and Europe (including a resumption of gas sales) as part of a ceasefire agreement. Russia may also reinforce efforts to shape facts on the ground in Ukraine and escalate the war, further weighing on the Ukrainian negotiation position and furthering the US administration’s perception that a ceasefire from a Ukrainian position of strength is not achievable.Ukraine’s European allies sought to salvage the situation at an already scheduled summit in London. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer highlighted that Europe needs to lead in terms of security guarantees for Ukraine by assembling \"a coalition of the willing.\" However, for the agreement to have credibility, it would likely need a US backstop. French President Macron floated an initial one-month ceasefire “in the air, at sea, and on energy infrastructure,” but a ceasefire without security guarantees was rejected by President Zelenskyy. Moreover, according to subsequent media releases, Macron’s statements do not fully reflect the UK’s preferred position. The chance of success of a European plan also depends on Russia's willingness to agree to it, a very unlikely scenario without Russian involvement so far, in our view.As a consequence of US drift from engagement with European defense, spending by European countries has picked up in recent years and is likely to rise further. In Germany, the coalition talks for the new government, for example, include discussions over a EUR 400bn special fund for defense, according to media reports. Similarly, the EU is looking at ways to allow for increased defense spending as well. However, even with significant additional spending, Europe’s militaries and defense industry are unlikely to be able to fully cover for a prolonged lapse of US support for Ukraine, provide a robust force deployment as a potential part of a ceasefire, and improve its own defense readiness all at the same time after decades of underinvestment.European markets initially reacted negatively to the meeting in the Oval Office: the euro sold off by 0.4% against the US dollar; the Polish zloty, one of the key beneficiaries in the FX space from any ceasefire, sold off by more than 1% against the euro initially; and futures on European equity indices dipped. However, these losses reversed on Monday—European markets even rose to start the week, buoyed by jumps in the shares of defense companies on the back of the likely increase in European spending. Markets may be focusing on the potential benefits of a ceasefire, including an improvement in sentiment and better energy availability in Europe. A deal along Russian terms could hold for quite some time. But one that leaves Ukraine vulnerable and Europe’s security in a state of disarray may limit the benefits from reconstruction and could create a backdrop for renewed shocks due to further conflict down the road. For more detailed investment implications, see our recent publications “What could an end to the war in Ukraine mean for Europe?” (18 February) and “Six ways to invest in Europe” (25 February). It is important to note though that not only the dynamics around Ukraine matter for the European outlook, but also US trade policies. After the US went ahead with tariffs against its key trading partners Canada and Mexico, Europe looks likely to be hit by tariffs as well.Finally, we highlight again that the path to a ceasefire is by no means certain. Negotiations may stall as the war continues, perpetuating a de facto status quo and failing to live up to market expectations. If, however, talks were to break down completely, an escalation could lead to markets reacting negatively, especially if there was greater perceived chance of direct military involvement by Western forces. Acts of sabotage or attacks on energy infrastructure in Russia or Ukraine, but also in third-party territories, could lead to commodity price spikes. No further funding and weapon support for Ukraine by the US may still see Ukraine continuing the fight with the remaining support from its other allies, though European support could come under pressure amid further Russian territorial gains and rising domestic opposition. This could also lead to a spike in risk premia for the region.US stocks fall on tech concerns and tariff threats\n 04 Mar 2025\nThought of the dayWhat happened?US stocks fell and bonds rose on Monday as tech weakness, escalating trade risks, and renewed economic growth concerns prompted a broad risk-off move. The S\u0026P 500 slid 1.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%, weighed down by an 8.8% decline in AI chipmaker NVIDIA. NVIDIA's decline accounted for 30% of the fall in the S\u0026P 500 index.Bonds rallied as investors sought safety, with the 10-year US Treasury yield falling 5 basis points overnight to around 4.16% right now. On Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 led declines with a 1.2% fall, while the Hang Seng index was down 0.3%. At the time of writing European stock indexes were trading 1-1.5% lower (DAX -1.9%) and S\u0026P 500 futures pointed to a 0.1% decline at the open.Several factors contributed to the decline in stocks.NVIDIA, already under pressure in recent days after its quarterly results disappointed high investor expectations, declined on concerns that additional export restrictions may be placed on its chips. Sentiment was also hurt by additional information released by DeepSeek over the weekend that appeared to refute the argument that its model incurs losses when offering inferencing services at their standard rates.US President Donald Trump on Monday confirmed he will go ahead with a new 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada, and will double tariffs on China to 20% over border and narcotics-related issues. Under the executive order, those tariffs went live at 12:01 EST AM. Trump also said that a separate order for reciprocal tariffs would come into effect on 2 April.Canada has retaliated with a 25% tariff on CAD 30bn of US imports, which will extend coverage to a further CAD 125bn of US imports in 21 days if no resolution is met. China enacted a 10-15% tariff effective 10 March, targeting a raft of US agricultural products ranging from beef and pork to dairy, fruit, and grains. Mexico is expected to announce its response within the next 12 hours.The impact of tariff threats on business sentiment was evident in the ISM Manufacturing PMI, which dipped to 50.5 in February, barely in expansion territory. The prices paid index rose considerably to its highest level since mid-2022, signaling increased cost pressures on businesses.Brent oil crude prices fell 1.8% on Monday and declined a further 1.3% today, after the eight OPEC+ member states with additional voluntary production cuts in place announced that they plan to start unwinding their production cuts gradually from April. The energy sector was among the hardest hit in the S\u0026P 500 on Monday, falling 3.5%. The OPEC+ statement reiterated the cautious stance of the group, indicating it can pause or even reverse Monday’s decision if market conditions require it. In our view, the oil market remains undersupplied, and there is no indication of a fight for market share, but rather a prudent unwind of the production cuts.What do we think?The AI investment cycle remains strong. Despite NVIDIA's post-earnings decline, the broader AI industry remains on solid footing, with demand for AI compute continuing to accelerate. NVIDIA's strong guidance reinforces the long-term AI investment cycle, supported by rising Big Tech capex, which is set to grow 35% in 2025 to USD 302 billion. AI spending is on track to reach USD 500bn by 2026, and the industry has projected a 36% CAGR for AI compute through 2029. AI adoption remains strong, with Big Tech citing that its issues lie in capacity constraints and not weak demand. This reinforces the improving monetization outlook, in our view.That said, the AI diffusion regulation announced by the US Department of Commerce on 13 January, if implemented as planned, will likely impose strict export controls, further complicating the geopolitical and economic landscape for AI advancement. The regulation would limit access to advanced AI hardware for tier-2 and tier-3 countries, curbing innovation and hindering the global expansion of US chip exports. These developments could potentially weigh on global growth.Since the launch of DeepSeek’s first model, there has also been a legitimate question about the terminal value of frontier models. AI algorithmic innovation is accelerating, leading to lower-cost inference. We expect these lower inference costs to lead to higher AI adoption and scaling laws to remain intact, leading to continued capex growth among hyperscalers that ultimately benefits hardware providers. At the same time, frontier models face more uncertain economics. We therefore recommend keeping diversified exposure to the AI value chain, focusing on vertically integrated companies along the value chain with strong exposure to the enabling and application layers.Trump’s policies pose risks to growth but thus far the direct economic impact remains limited. While the tariff rhetoric has unsettled markets, we see it as part of President Trump’s negotiation strategy rather than a fundamental shift in trade policy. He has historically used aggressive language as leverage, often walking back threats after securing concessions. On Monday, for example, TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, announced plans to make an additional USD 100bn investment in the US and build five additional chip factories. Though near-term uncertainty remains high, we do not expect tariffs on key trading partners to be broad, sustained, or disruptive enough to derail US economic momentum.Economic growth concerns persist, but consumer fundamentals remain intact. The latest ISM manufacturing PMI weakened as tariff uncertainty weighed on business activity, while rising input costs kept inflation risks in focus. Still, January’s price consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data confirmed a gradual move toward the Fed’s 2% target, and the labor data remain solid with rising wages and low unemployment, despite a modest rise in jobless claims last week. While trade tensions add uncertainty, the overall economic outlook remains stable, with Friday’s payrolls report set to provide further clarity on labor market conditions.How do we invest?Navigate political risks. Tariff-related uncertainty and trade policy shifts reinforce the need for portfolio diversification and risk management. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage the risks of equity losses, while mean-reversion strategies could be an effective way to harness increased volatility. We continue to favor high-quality fixed income such as investment grade corporate bonds, which provide insulation against trade risks. Additionally, long USDCNY positions could hedge trade-related risks, while CAD and MXN exposure should be hedged or avoided in the near term. Gold remains an effective hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks, and certain hedge fund strategies may offer resilience in volatile markets.More to go in stocks. Despite tech sector weakness and trade-related concerns, we continue to expect resilience in US equities, supported by solid earnings and AI tailwinds. NVIDIA's post-earnings pullback weighed on sentiment, but its strong guidance and AI-driven capex trends reinforce our confidence in AI as a structural growth driver, even amid short-term volatility. Without taking any single name views, while market sentiment remains sensitive to AI demand trends and tariff risks, we believe that earnings growth, AI investments, and economic stability should continue to support stocks.So, while volatility may persist, we continue to see room for gains in equities, supported by resilient earnings, AI-driven tailwinds, and monetary policy easing. Despite trade uncertainty and economic concerns, inflation continues to moderate, Fed policy remains accommodative, and corporate earnings have been solid, reinforcing our view that the S\u0026P 500 can reach 6,600 by year-end.Caught our attentionTrump's Russia thaw continues. US President Donald Trump late Monday deepened his break with US ally Ukraine, ordering an immediate halt of US military assistance including the delivery of weapon stockpiles. The freeze follows last Friday's public dispute between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which Trump again raised in social media criticism on Monday. Separately, Reuters reported the White House has asked the state and treasury departments for a list of sanctions on Russia that could be eased. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement reportedly suggested White House actions would help “get the Russians to a negotiating table.” This comes amid a renewed European effort, led by the UK and France, to broker a ceasefire and prepare a sustainable peace plan. The Financial Times reports France, Germany, and the UK may agree to seize more than EUR 200bn of frozen Russian assets if Russia were to violate a potential ceasefire deal in Ukraine.Our view: We have long argued a quick Russia-Ukraine agreement would be unlikely due to mistrust and differing objectives between the two countries. The White House's lack of support may complicate Ukraine's efforts to control current territory and weigh on its negotiating stance into peace talks. Regardless of how effective this new Trump strategy proves, we think European defense spending is set to rise significantly, and EU security policy will take on greater urgency. While we think a Neutral stance on Eurozone equities is still warranted, we recently upgraded our index target in part on the outlook for greater defense spending. We believe the European defense market will prove to be one of the most attractive end markets, characterized by high visibility and reduced cyclicality due to structural growth drivers. If a lasting peace deal is eventually reached, we think Eurozone building materials and industrial companies would likely be among the beneficiaries of reconstruction efforts.Markets brace for volatility amid Trump policy showdown\n 03 Mar 2025\nThought of the dayUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the White House on Friday capped a volatile week for markets as investors contended with fast-moving geopolitical developments, tech jitters, mixed economic data, and renewed tariff threats. The S\u0026P 500 ended the week 1% lower, and volatility looks set to continue this week.British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said over the weekend that European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to discuss with the US, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a step-up in defense investment. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order launching an investigation into the national security harm posed by lumber imports, after vowing to press ahead with the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods from tomorrow.The volume, breadth, and speed of President Trump’s executive actions have caused elevated levels of uncertainty since his inaugura tion six weeks ago as markets consider a wide range of potential outcomes. Hasty policymaking across a broad range of areas could also lead to indirect risks to growth.But we note that the US economy is entering this period of heightened uncertainty in robust health, notwithstanding the tariff-induced volatility in the trade deficit. Underlying growth in themes like artificial intelligence and electrification should also remain unaffected by the scope of the policy measures announced so far. We think investors should consider the broader context as they navigate headlines on US trade, foreign, and domestic policies.Trump is likely seeking trade deals to avoid putting US economic activity at risk. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods will go into effect tomorrow, but the exact level of the levies “is a fluid situation.” We do not expect tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be large, broad, or sustained as this would have a strong direct impact on US growth and inflation that the Trump administration would want to avoid. While an average effective tariff rate of 30% on Chinese imports is within our base case, and we would expect more countries to be threatened with tariffs after Trump’s team evaluates reciprocal tariffs, we also expect various deals to be struck to limit their overall breadth and scale. We believe Trump will be willing to seek deals in the first 100 days of his administration to demonstrate his negotiating power.A ceasefire in Ukraine remains likely this year amid greater European defense spending. The US-Ukraine minerals agreement did not get signed following the clash between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, but we think it is too soon to conclude on the role US will play in the potential ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine. We have highlighted that an imminent halt to the conflict is unlikely, but believe that a truce can be reached over the course of this year, with rising defense spending from European countries. We expect select defense stocks in the region to benefit from rising security investments, but would recommend preparing for such outcomes through structured strategies, given the still elevated uncertainty on the outlook.President Trump’s domestic policies pose risks but the direct impact on the economy is limited so far. The US government faces a potential shutdown later this month if a bipartisan deal on funding cannot be reached, while a prolonged impasse over the debt ceiling looms in the summer. But we would expect the economy to bounce back quickly once funding is restored. The longest previous shutdown was 35 days during the first Trump administration, which hit first-quarter 2019 growth by 0.2%. Overall, we note the risks of slower growth and higher inflation due to the second-order effects and hasty execution of Trump’s domestic policies, but the direct impact on growth and inflation from measures announced so far has yet to be significant.So, to navigate the volatility in the weeks and months ahead, we recommend being invested in stocks, with a focus on the US, AI, and power and resources themes, but also hedging those equity exposures to manage near-term risks. Investors should also ensure portfolios are well diversified with assets including quality bonds, gold, and alternatives.Caught our attentionUS-Ukraine break accelerates Europe's response. A high-profile, on-camera clash between US President Trump and Ukraine President Zelenskyy has put the onus on UK and European leaders to accelerate and strengthen their security and diplomatic response to the Ukraine-Russia war. UK Prime Minister Starmer, who over the weekend played host to European leaders and Canada, said on Sunday that a draft peace plan had been agreed and would be presented to the US. While no details were shared, French President Macron had told Le Figaro newspaper prior to the summit the proposal was built around a one-month truce covering “air, sea, and energy infrastructure attacks” but not ground fighting. The proposal apparently calls for European peacekeepers to eventually be deployed in a second phase, under the assumption the initial truce produces a workable peace framework. NATO Secretary General Rutte on the weekend urged Zelenskyy to repair his relationship with Trump following the on-camera clash, and also revealed several EU leaders at the summit detailed private plans to ramp up their respective defense spending.Our view: It is too soon to see what this public Ukraine-US dispute will mean for US engagement and ceasefire prospects. We have argued a quick agreement would be unlikely due to mistrust and differing objectives between Moscow and Kyiv. A more positive outcome of a lasting ceasefire would likely serve as a supportive catalyst for European equities and the euro. Regardless, we anticipate a step up in European defense spending and a larger EU policy focus on security, with markets now focused on the potential for new joint European borrowing to fund this defense spending. While we think a neutral stance on Eurozone equities is still warranted, we recently upgraded our index target for several reasons including the outlook for defense spending. We believe the European defense market will be one of the most attractive end-markets, characterized by high visibility and reduced cyclicality due to structural growth drivers. If a lasting peace deal is reached, we think Eurozone building materials and industrial companies would likely be among the beneficiaries of reconstruction efforts.Tariff wiggle room for Canada/Mexico? US President Trump will press ahead with new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods tomorrow, according to US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, but the exact percentage level to be imposed is “a fluid situation” and may not be 25%. Speaking on Fox TV on Sunday, Lutnick suggested Trump's decision could swing based on continued talks between the three trade partners. By contrast, Lutnick indicated the additional 10% levy threatened for Chinese imports is “set,” unless Beijing can “end the subsidies and end making these ingredients from fentanyl.” Separately, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday suggested Mexico was considering matching US tariffs on Chinese goods, in a “very interesting” move that he thought Canada should also match. Trump, meanwhile, on the weekend signed a new executive order launching an investigation into US lumber imports, targeting a key Canadian export to its southern neighbor.Our view: Conflicting messages from Trump and his officials have added to investor uncertainty ahead of the 4 March tariff date. On one hand, the US economy is still in good shape, which may give the White House more leeway in adopting more aggressive tariffs. But highly aggressive US tariffs would also likely add to inflationary pressure and market volatility. Our base case remains that the administration will seek to stop short of measures that risk rekindling inflation or undermining markets. Tariff uncertainty does bolster the case for quality fixed income as part of a more resilient portfolio mix, in our view. We recommend diversifying and boosting portfolio income through diversified fixed income strategies, senior loans, private credit, and equity income strategies.US personal spending declines while goods trade deficit hits record high. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, core PCE, fell to 2.6% in January, the smallest increase since early 2021 and down from December's revised figure of 2.9%. Personal spending pulled back following December’s strong gains, while personal income rose, supported by labor market strength and cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security payments. More notably, the US goods trade deficit widened to a record USD 153 billion as imports surged 12%, with physical gold inflating the data. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow estimate for first quarter growth fell to -1.5% annualized, down from a positive 2.3% growth rate the prior reading on 19 February. This was largely due to net exports dragging on GDP, though consensus forecasts from economists remain around +1.5%.Our view: While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, January's data signaled some progress. Moreover, the GDPNow drop may appear concerning, but we see it as noise rather than a sign of an economic contraction. This week’s key data releases include the February jobs report, ISM PMIs, and the Fed’s Beige Book, which will provide insight into business sentiment under the new administration. Against this backdrop, we expect two US rate cuts in 2025, and we continue to favor US equities and high-quality fixed income, including investment grade corporate bonds and 5-year Treasuries.US announces 10% additional tariff on China\n 28 Feb 2025\nWhat happenedUS President Donald Trump announced on social media on 27 February that the US will impose an additional 10% tariff on China with effect from 4 March, citing fentanyl-related concerns, in addition to the 10% tariff already imposed on 4 February.Our viewThe moves align with our base case of a 20% tariff hike on China, but the timing is earlier than expected. The 20% tariff hike is estimated to result in a 0.7-1ppt drag on China's GDP growth.More pressure on China may emerge following the United States Trade Representative's (USTR) trade review report on 1 April, depending on progress in ongoing Sino-US negotiations. While China is likely to face threats of more tariffs and other export restrictions, we think any further escalation of tariffs beyond our base case may be more targeted and selective—i.e., relatively higher tariffs on more substitutable capital and intermediate goods, and less so on sensitive consumer goods, if Trump wants to limit the growth and inflation impact on the US.China’s response is expected to remain measured, largely following the recent playbook, to allow room for continued negotiations. To recap, China’s retaliation to the last US 10% tariff hike mainly included a 10-15% tariff hike on USD 14bn (~9%) of US goods and export controls on more rare materials, alongside symbolic moves on some US companies. The strong CNY fixing on Friday also signals the PBoC’s preference to keep the currency relatively stable for now.Meanwhile, China and the US are continuing their negotiations on two key issues, namely illegal immigrants and fentanyl control. Trump may also seek China’s assistance in facilitating a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire deal. On 21 February, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had an introductory video call with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to exchange bilateral views on trade and other important issues.The new 10% tariff comes into effect on 4 March, just a day before China holds its annual National People's Congress (NPC) meeting. We think a slightly stronger stimulus package—say at the higher end of CNY 2-4tr expectations—could be announced at the meeting. Policymakers may pay close attention to the pressure on the USDCNY and the capital market, and the stimulus measures could kick in faster after the NPC meeting if they perceive a stronger negative impact. We also expect the Chinese government to announce further support for the private sector, particularly strategic areas like AI, advanced manufacturing, and critical materials.Markets rebound as Trump outlines reciprocal tariffs\n 14 Feb 2025\nEquities and bonds both rallied on Thursday after US President Trump directed his administration to evaluate reciprocal tariffs, but he stopped short of imposing immediate measures.The directive instructs the US Trade Representative and Commerce Department to develop country-specific import taxes, factoring in non-tariff barriers such as value-added taxes (VATs), subsidies, currency policies, and digital services taxes. However, the process could take weeks or months, with no set timeline for implementation.Trump cited European VAT policies as an example of unfair trade practices, while a White House official pointed to Japan and South Korea as potential targets. Developing economies with higher tariffs on US products are also likely to be affected. Unlike his 2024 campaign proposal for a universal import tax, this approach appears more tailored but leaves room for broader action.For now, the delay in implementation limits the immediate market impact, but the risk of retaliation remains. If negotiations stall, the EU, Japan, and South Korea could respond with countermeasures, adding to trade uncertainty, inflation pressures, and market volatility.Following the news, the S\u0026P 500 rose 1% and 10-year Treasury yields fell 9 basis points on Thursday, as markets rebounded from Wednesday’s sell-off driven by the consumer price index (CPI) release, reassured by the lack of immediate action. Markets also appeared to have a dovish read on Thursday’s producer price index (PPI) report, as core PPI, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.3%, in line with consensus estimates, with price gains concentrated in energy and food rather than reflecting broad-based inflationary pressures. On Friday, Chinese equities extended their recent rally, though regional indices saw mixed performance with Japanese equities slipping on a stronger yen.What do we thinkMarkets found relief following the announcement. Wednesday’s CPI data led to a sell-off as investors scaled back expectations of rate cuts, but markets rallied on Thursday as they processed that Trump’s directive does not impose tariffs immediately. The delay suggests this could be a negotiation tactic rather than a firm commitment, similar to how Trump previously used tariff threats to extract trade concessions from Mexico, Canada, and Colombia. That said, the prospect of higher duties on autos, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals still adds to trade uncertainty.While these were just threats, threats lead to negotiation. The EU preemptively offered to cut tariffs on US cars, hoping to avoid escalation and protect its struggling auto industry. Bernd Lange, head of the European Parliament’s trade committee, said the bloc could lower its 10% tariff closer to the US’s 2.5% rate as part of a broader deal that includes increased LNG and military equipment purchases. European automakers support the move, while EU officials believe that existing tariffs on Chinese EVs will prevent a flood of imports. If talks fail, Brussels is prepared to retaliate against US tech and financial firms using new trade enforcement tools designed after Trump’s first term. Following an in-person meeting with India’s prime minister, Trump said the two countries would seek to reduce “very high” Indian tariffs on US goods and strike deals for the purchase of US oil, gas, and combat aircraft.Our base case is a scenario of “selective tariffs.” We do not expect sustained blanket universal tariffs but rather targeted measures and negotiation-driven outcomes. Highly aggressive US tariffs would almost certainly trigger retaliation by US trading partners, and there are risks of a tit-for-tat ratcheting up of measures. Markets will be watching closely for any shifts toward full enforcement, as a broad implementation of tariffs would raise inflation risks and likely weigh on equities, and have the potential to dent, but not derail, US economic growth.How do we investNavigate political risks. The latest tariff directive from the Trump administration introduces heightened uncertainty in global trade, reinforcing the need for portfolio diversification and hedging approaches, in our view. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage downside risks. As volatility and skew are low relative to current levels of uncertainty, mean reversion strategies can also be an effective way to harness higher volatility. We like high grade and investment grade bonds, as they offer some insulation against uncertainty and can help diversify portfolios. Separately, we believe long USDCNY could be an effective hedge against trade risks, while CAD and MXN long exposure should be hedged or avoided in the near term. Gold also remains an effective hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks, in our view. For investors willing and able to manage risks inherent in alternatives, we also think certain hedge fund strategies are well positioned to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns and portfolio resilience during market volatility.More to go in equities. Despite the administration’s push for reciprocal tariffs, we expect market resilience, particularly in US equities, as economic growth remains intact. We will continue to monitor trade policy closely. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico are unlikely to be sustained, US economic growth should represent a tailwind for stocks, and we continue to believe that AI presents a powerful structural tailwind for earnings and equity markets. Our base case remains for the S\u0026P 500 to rise to 6,600 by year-end.Harvest currency volatility. The reciprocal tariff framework and continued uncertainty around trade negotiations are likely to fuel currency volatility, providing an opportunity to use volatility spikes to boost portfolio income. Over the next one to three months, and while trade uncertainty remains particularly elevated, we like picking up yield by selling the upside in the EURUSD and downside in the USDCHF. Over the next six months, we like selling the upside in the CHFJPY, the EURGBP, and the EURAUD, and the downside in the GBPUSD, the GBPCHF, and the AUDUSD. While the US dollar has room to strengthen in the near term, we expect it to give up its gains over the balance of 2025.VP Vance threatens sanctions, military action over peace deal\n 14 Feb 2025\nUS Vice President JD Vance threatened both economic and military “tools of leverage” against Russia if a peace deal is not reached that ensures Ukrainian independence. Vance told a Wall Street Journal reporter that everything was on the table, and President Trump was “not going into this with blinders on.” Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy later today at the Munich Security Conference. President Trump earlier this week held calls with both Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a bid to begin negotiations to end the war. In recent days, global markets have positioned for progress toward a negotiated end of the Russia-Ukraine war, which began almost three years ago, with the euro and eastern European currencies strengthening, European equities rising, and oil prices easing.Our viewOur base case is for a ceasefire to be reached during the year, though negotiations may be protracted given the lack of trust and distance between desired outcomes. Ending the fighting would likely involve Ukraine losing some territory—with the goal of reclaiming it later via diplomatic means—but gaining security guarantees and reconstruction commitments. Russia may negotiate sanctions relief and partial gas flow resumption to Europe. However, gas flows are unlikely to return to pre-war levels, in our view. Upside scenarios include rapid progress toward a ceasefire—an outcome that we believe the market is currently partially pricing in. But the path to a ceasefire is by no means certain. Moreover, while we think that while the Kremlin’s calculus ultimately favors a deal, it appears in no hurry to accept one.For investors, we continue to recommend regional diversification and a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments to protect against geopolitically induced market turbulence while also being exposed to positive risk scenarios. In the current situation, we caution against taking an overly narrow view on individual assets purely from the perspective of a perceived increase in likelihood of a ceasefire in Ukraine. Global growth and inflation dynamics, central banks’ policy decisions, and the Trump administration’s trade policies remain the more relevant drivers of portfolio returns, in our view. Accordingly, we favor putting cash to work in stocks and high grade and investment grade bonds and considering investment in the AI opportunity and power and resources. We see hedges for political risks—not only around the war in Ukraine—in gold, oil, and via using structured investments.

The administration looks set to end carve-outs, quota deals, and exemptions for partner nations that expanded under both him and his successor, Joe Biden. The new tariffs, which the White House says will take effect on 4 March, will expand to cover a wide range of downstream metal products.When asked about potential retaliation from the US's trade partners, Reuters reports Trump said “I don't mind.” Canada’s industry minister said he is consulting with “international partners,” and the response will be “clear and calibrated.”Other tariffs may also be coming, with Trump reiterating plans in the coming days for “reciprocal tariffs” on all countries that impose duties on US goods. This round follows the on-then-off plan earlier this month to levy a 25% tariff on most Canadian imports—except for energy, which had a lower 10% rate—and all Mexican imports over disputes around narcotics and immigration control. While Trump ultimately hit pause on those tariffs, he did move forward with a 10% blanket tariff increase on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.Unlike last week's whipsaw response to tariffs, in which risk assets sold off and then recovered, the market reaction thus far has been fairly muted. The CBOE VIX Index of implied US equity volatility remains subdued at 16 points, within range of its 2025 lows. Gold hit a fresh all-time high of USD 2,942 an ounce, before giving up some gains to USD 2,905/oz—still about 12% up since late December.With investors taking more of a tempered approach, we make several observations:Trade imbalances cannot easily be negotiated. While the US imports close to 25% of its steel and nearly 70% of aluminum, its reliance varies. Steel production has room to expand if prices justify it, given existing overcapacity and new plants coming online. Aluminum, however, is far more import-dependent, with high costs and regulatory hurdles making domestic expansion unlikely. We are skeptical of this outcome given high US wages and other barriers such as environmental factors, permitting backlogs, long lead times for new facilities, and capital discipline by smelters, which are reluctant to invest in long-term projects unless prices remain elevated for an extended period. Other exporters of metals to the US, such as South Korea and Brazil, also have sizable trade surpluses with the US. Making matters more difficult, the strong US dollar side effect of higher US tariffs may also exacerbate the US trade deficit as it limits foreign buying power for US goods.It’s also important to distinguish between the different tariff categories under consideration. The steel and aluminum tariffs fall under Section 232, a provision for addressing national security concerns, while the broader reciprocal tariffs would be issued under Section 301 to address unfair trade practices. The steel and aluminum tariffs have been in force since 2018. While Trump initially made clear there would be no exceptions, he later left the door open to a possible exception for Australia, citing its trade surplus with the US and its large purchases of US aircraft. With the executive order not yet published, markets will await more clarity beyond the headlines on both the legal basis and final details on exemptions, quotas, and effective rates.The metal tariffs may serve as negotiating leverage. The US is heavily dependent on its North American partners for the two metals: Canada is its number one export partner for both aluminum and steel, while Mexico ranks third for steel and is a major provider of scrap aluminum and alloys. Trump's team may be seeking to accelerate a renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade pact. Ultimately, we believe if these specific tariffs are imposed, the relative growth hit to the US economy will be more manageable than the ones Mexico or Canada would face.Other partners with higher barriers to US goods are on notice. Under our base-case tariff scenario, we've been arguing that nations with higher average/effective tariffs will face the risk of higher US tariffs. The trade-weighted versus average tariffs can vary significantly, but the distinction may not be important to the White House. Outside of North America, South Korea, Vietnam, India, and Brazil stand out for higher average tariffs. The European Union is lower on the list, but several categories like autos and food have high barriers, and the underlying value of trade at risk is significant.So, despite the relative calm in markets this week, we believe investors need to remain vigilant to changes in trade and tariff policies. We still expect that a solid US economy, AI tailwinds, and gradual Federal Reserve rate cuts will offer a favorable backdrop for equities. Our base case remains for the S\u0026P 500 to rise to 6,600 by year-end. Volatile markets do require an increased focus on portfolio diversification and hedging approaches. In equities, capital preservation strategies can potentially help limit portfolio losses. Changes to trade policy tend to have a notable impact on currency markets, providing investors an opportunity to use volatility spikes to boost portfolio income. We continue to see gold as an effective portfolio hedge and diversifier, and believe an allocation of around 5% within a USD balanced portfolio is optimal.Mexico among most exposed to US trade policy\n 10 Feb 2025\nMexico remains among the most exposed countries to changes in US trade policy. Over USD 1.2 million in products move across the border every minute, making it the busiest in the world. As an example, Texas’s trade with Mexico is larger than the United States’ trade with Japan and Spain combined. While a 25% tariff on Mexican imports was postponed after last-minute negotiations, Damocles' sword continues to hang over Mexico’s head.Mexico has responded with a cooperative approach, deploying additional National Guard troops to curb migration and stepping up fentanyl seizures. These moves align with US priorities, but what further measures might come from the Trump administration remain anyone’s guess.Mexico is deeply integrated into North American supply chains, primarily exporting intermediate goods. With modern supply chains, a single component in a vehicle can cross the US border between six and eight times before final assembly. This interdependence means that aggressive tariffs wouldn’t just hurt Mexico—they would also raise costs for US manufacturers and consumers, potentially fueling inflation.Most LatAm exports are commodity based; Mexico stands outTop export products to the US by country of origin, data as of 2022Country of originCountry of originEport products to the USEport products to the USCountry of originBrazilEport products to the USSoybeans, iron ore, crude petroleumCountry of originChileEport products to the USCopper ore, wine, fishCountry of originColumbiaEport products to the USPetroleum and derivates, coal, coffeeCountry of originMexicoEport products to the USElectrical manufactures, vehicles, machineryCountry of originPeruEport products to the USCopper ore, gold, fishThe idea that automakers could quickly shift production to the US or another country is unrealistic; building new auto plants in the US would take years and billions of dollars in investment. We therefore believe the tariffs threat will remain a negotiation tool. However, the risk of them becoming a permanent fixture is real, particularly given Trump’s focus on trade deficits—an issue that cannot be easily “negotiated away.”For now, the Sheinbaum administration appears to recognize the need for constructive engagement and has already taken steps to align with US priorities. Recent actions include increased fentanyl seizures, new tariffs on Chinese imports, and enhanced enforcement measures against illegal immigration.Mexico's continued measures to reduce Asian importsTariffs placed on Asian economies since last yearDateDateProductProductTariffTariffDateApr-24ProductIron and steel productsTariff20-50%DateApr-24ProductClothing and textilesTariff35%DateApr-24ProductAluminum and other metal manufacturesTariff25-35%DateDec-24ProductReady-made goods and textilesTariff35%, 15%DateDec-24ProductSteel welding wire (Vietnam)Tariff36%DateJan-25ProductE-commerce products (countries with no trade agreements)Tariff19%If Sheinbaum’s administration continues to align with US priorities, this should help stabilize investor sentiment.

We published initial views on the effect of a Trump 2.0 administration in our report “What do Trump’s Executive actions mean for climate?” (January 24, 2025).The \"Unleashing American Energy\" policy underpins the administration's intent with regard to the energy sector, including climate action. The policy promotes energy exploration and fossil fuel energy production, aiming to reduce regulatory barriers for energy production while minimizing explicit considerations of climate change. Despite the early announcements, the scope of the full implementation of the policy remains unclear. The White House issued a 90-day pause on the disbursement of funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, specifically targeting EV infrastructure and climate mitigation. However, a court halted the pause, and as of February 7, the Department of Energy web site listed a notice restricting any implementation of the executive order. Similarly, a short-term pause in permitting for 168 renewable energy projects by the US Army Corps of Engineers was also lifted as of February 6. We expect this back and forth to be a recurring feature of policymaking in the space.While climate policy remains fluid and creates near-term volatility, we reiterate our view that the economic viability of investment in the transition to a low carbon economy—and renewable sources of energy in particular—depends primarily on economic viability. Private capital now accounts for a majority of global climate capital flows, outpacing public funding.President Trump’s administration also took steps that alter the landscape and conversation on social issues in the United States as well. The administration terminated all DEI programs across federal agencies, including in any federal contracts. It also took steps related to LGBTQ health care topics, among other issues. The implications of the guidance beyond the federal government will materialize over time and is not clear, but our expectation is that the impact to investable strategies will not be significant. Any impact would be through possible changes in the voluntary disclosures of companies, which might face elevated risks for litigation on a range of social (as well as environmental) disclosures. The initial response from large companies has been mixed, with a number of issuers walking back headlines on diversity, and others defending corporate policies that are financially relevant. We do expect US corporates to shift their messaging on diversity, focusing on corporate culture and employee well-being as proxies for the same goals.Investor takeaways:We expect policy uncertainty on energy, climate, and diversity topics to continue, which is likely to translate into volatility for investments in areas tied to sustainability.Regardless of fuel source, energy efficiency and infrastructure investment needs are clear, driven by aging infrastructure and consistent energy demand growth. Transmission and distribution segments, which are less sensitive to policy changes, present growth opportunities.On diversity, we expect companies to focus on workforce management policies that enhance their employee recruitment and retention, while minimizing explicit language and objectives around DEI, which might hurt investable universes with a focus on this topic.For more, download the full Sustainable investing perspectives report, “EU Sustainability Omnibus, Trump 2.0 impact, and catastrophe bonds.” UBS Explains: The impact of Trump's tariffs on bonds and equities\n 07 Feb 2025\nWhat do Trump's tariffs mean for bonds and equities?

The memorandum requests the Secretary of State and the US Treasury Department to implement a campaign aimed at driving Iran’s oil exports to zero. The oil market reaction has been muted, as President Trump also indicated he prefers to work out a deal with Iran rather than signing the memorandum.Hence, given that reluctance, market participants will likely closely watch how the US Treasury Department intends to enforce existing sanctions and if new sanctions are announced, what they may target. On Thursday, the US Treasury Department issued new sanctions targeting, among others, three tankers out of an estimated 280 dark fleet tankers involved in shipping Iranian barrels. It is unclear how the sanctions will affect Iranian oil exports or the impact on buyers of said oil.Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei said on Friday it would be \"unwise and dishonorable\" to negotiate with the United States, but did not rule out the possibility of talks. He also added it was the current US president who chose to break the previous nuclear deal. So it remains unclear whether the two parties are willing to negotiate a new deal.Oil market participants will likely keep a close eye on whether the US Treasury Department makes further announcements over the coming weeks. While January crude exports from Iran look to have been lower than in previous months, it remains unclear how buyers of Iranian barrels will react to the new US administration. Imports of Iranian barrels in China seem to be falling, while Iranian crude stored on tankers (so-called floating storage) is rising. This indicates that while Iranian exports haven't been significantly disrupted, there is some reluctance to buy those barrels. We continue to expect that Iranian crude exports may get somewhat disrupted over the coming months.We also remain surprised that market participants still react to President Trump's comments when it comes to bringing down oil prices. On Thursday, he said the US will have \"more liquid gold coming out of the ground\" and that will drive the price of oil down. But there is currently no indication of accelerating US drilling activity. We expect only muted US crude production growth in 2025. The only certainty to us is that comments from President Trump will continue to drive volatility in the oil market.\n 04 Feb 2025\nEquities had a volatile start to the week after the Trump administration pushed forward with plans to impose higher tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China over the weekend. The S\u0026P 500 closed down 0.8% on Monday.But this was a smaller decline than futures had initially indicated. Sentiment partially recovered after news that the threatened tariff hikes on Mexico would be delayed by at least a month following concessions on border security and enforcement. Later, Canada announced a similar pause after it revealed its own incremental border control measures and funding pledges.These delays revived hopes that President Trump's tariff threats may be more negotiable than previously thought. While no such deal has emerged to forestall the 10% incremental tariff on Chinese imports, which are now technically in effect, China's response was viewed as relatively muted—including 10-15% levies on US energy and agricultural tools. The measured nature of China's retaliation appeared intended to avoid further escalation. The Hang Seng Index closed 2.8% higher.But uncertainty remains high. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions we have been receiving from investors:1. Why is President Trump targeting these countries?The US president has long stated his enthusiasm for tariffs. But some of his initial targets have come as a surprise—with an additional 25% tariff for neighbors Canada and Mexico. China, a more long-standing trade rival, has also been included, though at a lower additional rate of 10%. The White House has said this reflects a desire to hold these nations “accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.” It is notable that concessions on border control from Mexico and Canada have been sufficient to delay the implementation of tariffs.The administration has also cited the bilateral trade deficits the US runs with these nations, which President Trump has said are evidence of unfair practices. President Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on the European Union, having criticized the trade bloc for the scale of its trade surplus with the US.2. How significant is trade with China, Mexico, and Canada for the US economy?The US is a relatively self-sufficient economy, with a relatively low reliance on foreign trade by international standards. Imports account for around 14% of US GDP, as of the latest full year of data from 2023. However, China, Canada, and Mexico account for 43% of those imports.Even this number may understate the importance of trade flows between the US and its neighbors. For example, a component for a US auto may cross the border with Mexico many times during assembly. If each move across the border were to trigger a 25% tariff for the US automaker, the supply chain would need to be adjusted.3. Why would energy face a lower tariff rate? Isn’t the US energy independent anyway?The US is a net exporter of both petroleum and natural gas. However, oil varies in consistency and refineries are configured to process different types of crude. Prior to the US shale revolution—which boosted US production of light oil—many US refineries were set up to process heavy oil, much of which is imported from Canada. As a result, high tariffs on Canadian crude would push up the politically sensitive price of gasoline, especially in the Midwest.4. Are these tariffs just a threat or the start of a new normal?This should become clear over the coming weeks and months. Last-minute reprieves for Colombia, Mexico, and Canada provide some hope that President Trump is using tariffs as a negotiating tool rather than a permanent fixture of economic policy. The administration also came under pressure from business groups to avoid a confrontation with Canada and Mexico. The National Manufacturers’ Association wrote that its members “understand the need to deal with any sort of crisis that involves illicit drugs crossing our border,” but also feels “protecting manufacturing gains that have come from our strong North American partnership is vital.” In our view, the president is unlikely to want to alienate key constituencies in his voter and funding base.5. Can we learn anything from factors that led to changes in tariff policies during Trump’s first term?Various potential lessons can be learned from Trump’s first term. It is notable that the momentum of higher tariffs against Chinese imports was slowed after the nation agreed to step up purchases of US goods.That said, the start of the second term has been different from the first term, and the mindset of the administration could be different this time. The key will be whether Trump has become convinced that tariffs are worthwhile in and of themselves, and not just a bargaining tool. This might become clearer in the coming weeks.6. Are there ways to avoid these tariffs for businesses and consumers?Global trade patterns can be rerouted over time to avert tariffs. After the first-term tariffs against China, China rerouted about a third of its exports to the US. That is not practical for Mexico and Canada, however, for simple reasons of geography. Also, some of China’s rerouting went via Mexico and Canada and could now be subject to tariffs.The higher the tariff rates, the more incentive there will be to take actions such as moving factories from China to neighboring low-wage countries. Of course, moving production to the US would be one way to avoid tariffs and the best outcome from the president’s viewpoint, but we are skeptical that there will be significant \"onshoring.\" Wages in the US are high, and retaliatory tariffs could make it difficult to export from any newly built factories in the US.7. What would be the effect on US growth and inflation if the tariffs do remain in place?The effect of a prolonged retaliatory exchange of tariffs is stagflationary—meaning that prices would experience a one-off increase, while we estimate expected growth would slow 80-100 basis points. As it stands, our base case is a scenario of “selective tariffs,” which have the potential to dent, but not derail, US economic growth.8. How about the impact on China, Mexico, and Canada?The prolonged imposition of tariffs may be enough to push the Canadian and Mexican economies into recession while also representing a sizable inflationary shock. The depreciation of their currencies as trade \"shock absorbers\" could mitigate some tariff-related shock to exports, but also reduces their international purchasing power. Mexico was already grappling with an economic slowdown, with GDP growth of just 1% expected in 2025 prior to the tariff announcement.9. What does it mean for global trade and global growth? Is the risk of a recession rising?Aggressive US tariffs would almost certainly trigger retaliation by US trading partners, and there are risks of a tit-for-tat ratcheting up of tariffs. Policy uncertainty is unusually high, which is damaging to global growth since it is difficult for businesses and consumers to make plans. The US and China are unlikely to suffer recessions even if tariffs prove significant, but other countries that are more reliant on bilateral trade with the US, especially Canada and Mexico, could be more vulnerable. Overall, we still think a global recession remains unlikely.10. How should I invest considering the uncertainty?Investors should prepare for market volatility and potential policy surprises by considering portfolio diversification and hedging approaches.Navigate political risks. More volatile markets require an increased focus on portfolio diversification and hedging approaches. In equities, capital preservation strategies can potentially help limit portfolio losses. As volatility and skew are low relative to current levels of uncertainty, mean-reversion strategies can also be an effective way to harness higher volatility. We like high-quality government and investment grade corporate bonds, as they offer appealing yields, some insulation against uncertainty, and can help diversify portfolios.More to go in equities. Although we will continue to monitor trade policy closely, our base case remains for the S\u0026P 500 to rise to 6,600 by year-end. If implemented, tariffs on Canada and Mexico are unlikely to be sustained, resilient US economic growth should support stocks, and we continue to believe that AI presents a powerful structural tailwind for earnings and equity markets. We believe that the recent development of DeepSeek, a lower-cost AI model, will lead to even broader proliferation of AI, enhancing growth and productivity.Harvest currency volatility. Changes to trade policy can particularly impact currency markets, providing investors an opportunity to use volatility spikes to boost portfolio income. Over the next one to three months, and while trade uncertainty remains particularly elevated, we like picking up yield by selling the risks of a rally in EURUSD and of a fall in USDCHF. Over the next six months, we like selling the risk of gains in the CHFJPY, the EURGBP, and the EURAUD exchange rates, and selling the risk of declines in the GBPUSD, the GBPCHF, and the AUDUSD crosses.Eurozone: EU tariffs will “definitely happen”\n 03 Feb 2025\nPresident Donald Trump has so far been true to his word, with trade taxes (tariffs) about to be imposed on Canada, Mexico (delayed by a month), and China. Governments, businesses, and consumers in Europe will have no doubt heard the president’s threat that tariffs on the EU will “definitely happen,” too. Even the UK, which has a negligible goods trade balance with the US, has been singled out by the president as being “way out of line.”The threat of tariffs has been looming since the election, and the EU and European governments have been preparing for this possibility. To be sure, Europe enjoys a large surplus in traded goods with the US across a range of industries. President Trump often cites a USD 300bn deficit in his speeches, but in terms of the overall footprint on the economy, notwithstanding the fact that the US is the most important export market for the bloc (Fig. 1), the numbers are a lot less dramatic. For the Eurozone, goods exports to the US are around 3% of GDP, and imports are close to 2%. Thus, the economic impact from the imposition of tariffs would be relatively small.However, what these estimates don’t show is the impact on sentiment in Europe. If companies decide to slow investment and pause hiring, and consumers respond by saving more and spending less, the impact on the economy is likely to be much bigger than suggested by the trade numbers alone. Another consideration is the impact of US trade taxes on other countries, notably China. If trade is redirected away from the US toward the Eurozone, without offsetting measures from the EU, it could lead to lower prices for imported goods—which would compound the disinflationary trends already under way. Finally, US tariffs could also harm growth globally, including in the US itself, which would weigh on EU exports. A weaker euro against the USD would, in our view, only partially offset these effects.In our base case, we assume US tariffs on select European goods are likely to come into force in the second half of this year, and this is one of the reasons for our slightly below consensus forecasts of 0.9% GDP growth this year for the region. However, the speed and hard line shown by the president to his closest neighbors raises the threat that a trade dispute with Europe could happen sooner. In our view, this increases the downside risks to Eurozone growth and inflation in the coming quarters.We currently look for the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue cutting rates by 25 basis points at every meeting in the first half of the year, only pausing when the deposit rate reaches the 2% neutral level. In our view, developments with regard to US trade policy in recent days only increase the risk that the ECB will have to take interest rates even lower to support the economy.For EMEA-based investors, we recommend they continue to implement strategies that can help portfolios Navigate political risks by considering portfolio diversification and hedging approaches. Volatility in FX markets is an opportunity to enhance portfolio yields by Harvesting currency volatility. Finally, lower rates in the Eurozone with the possibility of more cuts than we foresee emphasize the need to Lock in yields.Tariff turmoil engulfs Mexico\n 02 Feb 2025\nWhat happened?The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and most imports from Canada, along with an additional 10% duty on all imports from China, effective 4 February. The executive order cites a national emergency due to “the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs” as the justification for these measures.In response, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has directed the economy minister to implement a plan that includes both tariff and non-tariff retaliatory measures. Sheinbaum is expected to announce the details of her plan early Monday.Our viewIn our base case, we anticipate that Mexico will adopt a pragmatic and cooperative approach, delivering a measured retaliatory response.We do not foresee the US's 25% tariff on Mexico remaining in place for an extended period of time, as this would be akin to cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face.Given that Mexico and Canada together account for approximately 30% of total US trade, permanent tariffs would pose significant economic risks to the US itself, thereby carrying political repercussions for the Trump administration.The economic fallout would be substantial, manifesting as higher costs for businesses, inflationary pressures, and potential job losses in industries reliant on North American supply chains. This move is likely to encounter fierce opposition and lobbying efforts from certain industry groups, as well as legal challenges.Similar to what happened during the recent Colombian tariff saga, the tariffs may pave the way for a deal, potentially including an early renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), rather than waiting for the review in 2026.However, the risk that these tariffs could become more permanent is real. US President Donald Trump has linked tariffs to trade deficits, which are not easily “negotiated” away. Unlike other issues such as border control, trade imbalances are more structural, driven by factors that extend far beyond tariff policy, and can take considerable time to adjust.Impact on the Mexican economyMexico was already grappling with an economic slowdown, with GDP growth expected at just 1% in 2025 prior to the tariff announcement. The 25% US tariff could potentially push the country into a recession, depending on its duration.The USD 800 billion annual trade relationship between Mexico and the US underscores the depth of their economic interdependence. Mexico’s economy is highly open and deeply reliant on the US, making it particularly vulnerable to trade disruptions. For instance, some car components cross the border multiple times before the vehicle is finally assembled, meaning even short-lived tariffs could lead to significant supply chain disruptions.In the longer term, we remain optimistic about North America’s economic integration and competitiveness. Over the past three decades, interconnected supply chains and cross-border infrastructure have strengthened the region’s industrial base, making economic decoupling unlikely.Most critically, the US cannot de-risk from both China and Mexico simultaneously without severely disrupting its own economy. Many of the intermediate goods supplied by Mexico are essential for American manufacturing competitiveness.Yet, we acknowledge that Trump may be steering the US toward a dramatically different direction. Uncertainty regarding international trade could become a constant over the next four years. In such a scenario, economic growth trends, financial market stability, and historical geo-economic alliances would face significant challenges.Investment implicationsThe USDMXN exchange rate was trading moderately weaker around 21.25 at the time of writing. Such a level does not fully price in the associated risks, in our view. Investors should consider hedging or avoiding MXN exposure in the near term.While Mexico’s sovereign US dollar-denominated bonds are already trading at wider spreads compared to similarly-rated sovereigns, spreads may widen further in the near term as investors price in the likelihood of a further decline in Mexico’s credit fundamentals due to the impact of tariffs. This comes at a time when Mexico's credit outlook is already deteriorating, influenced by recent constitutional reforms and concerns about the fiscal consolidation this year. We maintain a neutral stance on Mexico’s sovereign US dollar bonds, but we believe the longer end of the yield curve remains the most vulnerable.Despite likely higher volatility, we think Mexican corporate issuers under our coverage are likely to remain resilient due to significant operations overseas, world-class management teams with a proven track record in handling challenging environments, liquid balance sheets, and healthy leverage ratios.CIO Alert: Trump presses ahead with tariffs\n 02 Feb 2025\nWhat happened?The Trump administration has signed executive orders to impose an additional 25% tariff on most imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% duty on all imports from China, citing a national emergency over “the extraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs.” Duties levied on Canadian “energy resources” will face a lower 10% tariff, although Mexican energy imports will face the full 25%. President Donald Trump also reiterated a threat to hike tariffs on the European Union, citing the “tremendous deficit” with the EU. He also said that he would “eventually” put tariffs on semiconductors, steel, copper, aluminum, and pharmaceuticals.In response, Canada's government has announced a 25% tariff on some US imports, starting with CAD 30bn worth of US goods on 4 February, to be followed by another CAD 125bn added in 21 days’ time. Canada is also said to be considering several additional measures, including restrictions on critical mineral and energy exports. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has also ordered retaliatory measures, and China's foreign minister has vowed to take “necessary countermeasures,” though neither provided additional details.At the time of writing, S\u0026P 500 futures are down 1.7%.What do we think?In our Monthly Letter: Prepare for Trump 2.0, we said that “aggressive” tariffs by the US, including 30% effective tariffs on Chinese imports and selective tariffs against EU imports, were within our base case scenario. We also said that such tariffs would be insufficient to derail US economic growth. However, we also said that tariffs against Canada and Mexico, if sustained, have the potential to inflict a “tariff shock” to US growth and risk higher US inflation, as Mexico and Canada together account for about 30% of the US’s total trade.In our base case, we do not expect the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be sustained for a prolonged period. The Trump administration would not want to jeopardize US economic growth or risk higher inflation by leaving the tariffs in place for a sustained period, and significant stock market volatility could lead to a change in approach. We would expect industry groups representing companies on the northern and southern borders to file court challenges and lobby for their removal. It is also possible that the tariffs against Canada and Mexico are merely a tactic to accelerate a renegotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is a free trade pact between the countries. The significant potential economic effect of the tariffs on Mexico and Canada may ultimately lead to concessions, even if their initial response has been to announce retaliation.At the same time, Trump's comments on Friday, which suggested that the tariffs were “purely economic,” linking them to the US’s bilateral trade deficits, are more concerning, in our view. Deficits cannot easily be \"negotiated\" in the same way as non-trade issues like migration and drug control. Meanwhile, we continue to believe that the US effective tariff rate in China will eventually rise to 30% (from the current 11%), even if Trump’s recent more diplomatic tone with China suggests the White House may believe it has something to gain from the more gradual approach.In the weeks ahead, tariffs are likely to represent an overhang on markets and contribute to volatility, at least until investors gain greater clarity on the path and destination of US trade policy.In the very near term, the period between now and implementation on Tuesday could provide a brief window for negotiation or compromise. Thereafter, we believe US Customs and Border Protection may need some weeks to implement the tariffs (based on the experience of tariffs imposed in 2018 and 2019), providing a potential further window for negotiation. Another key date is 1 April, the deadline for federal agencies to report back their findings on persistent trade deficits and “unfair” trade policies—a report which could be a catalyst for additional tariffs. Earlier last week, the Financial Times reported that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is proposing a gradualist approach on universal tariffs, starting at 2.5%, with a monthly step-up of 2.5 percentage points until they reach as high as 20%, while Trump had singled out tariffs on computer chips, medicine, and metal imports.How to invest?Navigate political risks. More volatile markets require an increased focus on portfolio diversification and hedging approaches. In equities, capital preservation strategies can help manage downside risks. As volatility and skew are low relative to current levels of uncertainty, mean reversion strategies can also be an effective way to harness higher volatility. We like high grade and investment grade bonds, as they offer some insulation against uncertainty and can help diversify portfolios. Separately, we believe long USDCNY could be an effective hedge against trade risks, while CAD and MXN long exposure should be hedged or avoided in the near term. Gold also remains an effective hedge against geopolitical and inflation risks, in our view. For investors willing and able to manage risks inherent in alternatives, we also think certain hedge fund strategies are well positioned to offer attractive riskadjusted returns and portfolio resilience during market volatility.More to go in equities. Although we will continue to monitor trade policy closely, our base case remains for the S\u0026P 500 to rise to 6,600 by year-end. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico are unlikely to be sustained, US economic growth should represent a tailwind for stocks, and we continue to believe that AI presents a powerful structural tailwind for earnings and equity markets. We believe that the recent development of DeepSeek, a lower cost AI model, will ultimately lead to even broader proliferation of AI, enhancing growth and productivity.Harvest currency volatility. Changes to trade policy are likely to be keenly felt in currency markets, providing investors an opportunity to use volatility spikes to boost portfolio income. Over the next one to three months, and while trade uncertainty remains particularly elevated, we like picking up yield by selling the upside in the EURUSD and downside in the USDCHF. Over the next six months, we like selling the upside in the CHFJPY, the EURGBP, and the EURAUD, and the downside in the GBPUSD, the GBPCHF, and the AUDUSD. While the US dollar has room to strengthen in the near term, we expect it to give up its gains over the balance of 2025.UBS Trending: Post-inauguration recap—what might happen to the markets\n 24 Jan 2025\nTrade wars, tariff threats, and trillion-dollar tax cuts—Trump 2.0’s economic agenda is taking shape.

Post-inauguration recap - what might happen to the markets\n\nTrade wars, tariff threats, and trillion dollar tax cuts.\n\nTrump 2.0 economic agenda is taking shape.\n\nBut here's what markets might be missing with the deficit already\n\ndouble its 2015 levels\n\nand universal tariffs looming for allies and competitors alike.\n\n2025 economic story could be unlike anything we've seen before.\n\nSo what does this mean for markets and your money?\n\nWell, we're going to break it all down for you right now on UBS\n\ntrending.\n\nHi everybody and welcome to trending.\n\nThank you so much for joining us today.\n\nMy name is Anthony Pastore.\n\nI'm here in the studio with my good friend and colleague Kurt\n\nReiman from the Chief Investment Office,\n\nwho's the Head of Fixed Income\n\nand also the editor of our Election Watch.\n\nYou were very busy with us in 2024\n\nas we were leading up to the election.\n\nNow we're post inauguration.\n\nSo here we go as 47.\n\nLikely to be pretty busy.\n\nI would, I would say so.\n\nAnd by the way, just to let our audience know, there is a website\n\nthat goes through all the materials\n\nand then some that we're going to be talking about today.\n\nWe'll flash it up on the screen a little bit later,\n\nbut it's ubs.com/potus47.\n\nSo Kurt let's get on with the conversation.\n\nWe all\n\neither watched or read about President Trump's inauguration\n\nspeech recently, and he touched on a lot within that speech.\n\nI want to start with inflation, though.\n\nI think that for our viewers and the our advisors,\n\nthe people that we talked to, that's a big issue.\n\nAnd it has been for years, even through the Biden administration.\n\nYou know, the Trump was talking about how his administration\n\nwould undertake this effort\n\nto bring inflation under control, etc., etc..\n\nWhat's your take on the policy proposals that we've seen?\n\nAnd obviously we know there are a lot of executive orders\n\nthat have already been,\n\nset and done, but specifically when it comes to inflation,\n\nwhat are you\n\nhearing from the president or what do you want to hear?\n\nWell, it was a key campaign issue.\n\nAnd voters said that they trusted Donald Trump and his presidency\n\nmore to be able to confront\n\nthe inflation threat and continue to bring it down.\n\nNow the numbers have started to stall out.\n\nCore inflation hasn't been moving as lower as quickly.\n\nThe bond markets taking notice, as you know, over the last\n\nseveral months since mid September when the fed initiated that 50\n\nbasis point rate cut, bond yields have have moved higher.\n\nSo and part of that is is higher inflation expectations.\n\nSo there's still more work to be done.\n\nThis this hasn't been solved.\n\nThe fed is even scaling back\n\nthe expected rate cuts over the course of this year.\n\nSo what can policy do to help bring inflation down.\n\nHe focused a lot on deregulation in his initial executive order.\n\nAnd in the inauguration speech.\n\nAnd within deregulation, one key area was energy.\n\nNow, it's not clear that,\n\njust because he's declared a national energy emergency.\n\nAnd this frees up the ability to maybe fast track\n\nsome electricity transmission or pipeline, permitting\n\nthat oil drillers are going to come along\n\nand ignore\n\nwhat has been a long held practice of capital discipline.\n\nSo oil prices aren't necessarily going to respond\n\nif producers\n\ndon't come along and start to respond with higher production.\n\nThey're pretty comfortable\n\nwith the prices that we're seeing today.\n\nJay Dobson has written extensively on this.\n\nThere have been some other efforts, and I\n\nand we know that discussion about the Department of Government\n\nEfficiency, there will be some effort there\n\nto use AI and other technologies, blockchain,\n\nin order to find out if there are some cost savings,\n\nsome efficiencies that can be,\n\nblended into government, just how aggressive they can be.\n\nI think there's some limits there.\n\nYou know, spending has been authorized by Congress.\n\nAnd so reducing that spending, you know, is\n\nwhat would bring the executive branch in conflict with Congress.\n\nAnd so that would potentially have to be sorted out.\n\nBut the the efforts here on the deregulatory front are intended,\n\nat least on first blush, to deal with bringing inflation down.\n\nThe problem is the other policies, when we think about,\n\nyou know, fiscal policy or tariffs or immigration, things\n\nthat we'll get into,\n\nthose tend to have opposite effects on inflation.\n\nIt tends to, we think, be at least a temporary,\n\nif not more permanent driver of sustained higher inflation.\n\nSo how those are implemented that could could be\n\nyou know important.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd look we know that the biggest probably the biggest issue\n\nthat voters went to the polls\n\nand pulled the lever on was the economy.\n\nExit polls showed that by a large percentage,\n\nthe economy was number one on everyone's\n\nminds, which, by the way,\n\nyou know, James Carville said that years ago.\n\nIt's about the economy, stupid. We know that.\n\nI mean, every time there's an election, it's always the economy.\n\nSo with inflation and then you just mentioned tariffs.\n\nTrump on the campaign trail\n\nsaid he was going to put tariffs\n\non a number of different countries to varying numbers.\n\nChina.\n\nWe've also got Canada and Mexico in there, some of\n\nthe Bric countries.\n\nAnd obviously we know about tariffs\n\nthat we pay for the increase\n\nthat the countries are getting in those percentages,\n\nwhether it's ten, 20, 50 or 60%.\n\nWhen you look at the big picture, talk about the impact\n\nthe tariffs could be having.\n\nAnd based on what we know or expect Trump to do.\n\nHow is that going to impact our economy?\n\nWell, I think there's been an evolution in the way that,\n\nTrump and his administration are thinking about tariffs\n\ninitially under the first administration, you might argue\n\nthat the focus was on bilateral trade deficits\n\nand trying to restore some equilibrium there.\n\nThat's probably still important,\n\nbut it's not the primary issue right now.\n\nThis administration is thinking\n\nif you want access to the US market,\n\nif you want access to the defense security umbrella,\n\nyou have to abide by certain\n\nnational ambitions\n\nthat the US has or even our geostrategic priorities.\n\nAnd so certain countries say, for example, India,\n\nthat has higher tariff rates,\n\non US products than we have on theirs\n\nthat, is buying, Russian gas.\n\nI think there's a question about,\n\nyou know, how will the administration perceive this?\n\nThe administration's\n\nalso been very clear about using tariffs for non-economic issues.\n\nThe whole fight with Canada and Mexico and China\n\nis about fentanyl and drug imports and migration.\n\nSo there may be off ramps for some of these threats\n\nif countries can exhibit some immediate change,\n\neither through border Patrol agents\n\nor cracking down on on drugs to avoid the\n\nwhat seems like it's an impending, tariff.\n\nThe data is February 1st.\n\nHe's also instructed an all of government approach to look at,\n\nyou know, whether there's been overproduction\n\nor whether there's been currency manipulation,\n\na whole range of issues to report back\n\nto the administration on April 1st.\n\nSo they're moving quickly.\n\nThey will be aggressive.\n\nThis is an administration that will be aggressive on tariffs.\n\nWe our scenarios envision that the effective rate\n\non on Chinese tariffs goes from around 10 to 11% today\n\nto something closer to 30% over the course\n\nof the next year or two, gradually staged in.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd we will see likely tariffs on,\n\nyou know, maybe on a more discrete basis,\n\nbut on Canada and Mexico\n\nfocusing on trans shipment of goods and rules of origin.\n\nAnd and then there's been this sticking\n\npoint on EU, cars\n\nas having a higher tariff rate on, on US\n\ncars than we have on there.\n\nSo there's, there's going to be lots of movement here.\n\nWasn't much discussed in the inauguration speech,\n\nbut in the days since, it's been back in the headlines,\n\nand we're likely to see more of this over the course\n\nof, of the next several years. Right? Yeah.\n\nThat's exactly I think the point.\n\nAnd we we're only, you know, a couple of days into the next\n\nthis administration.\n\nSo on already\n\nthe amount of executive orders\n\nand the actions that are have taken are,\n\nquite, quite a lot to digest.\n\nThe other one, of course,\n\nwhich is a very sensitive\n\ntopic, is the border security and immigration policy.\n\nAnd we know that on the campaign\n\ntrail, Trump was very, very adamant about getting\n\nthe border under control through various means.\n\nAnd he's already taking those steps.\n\nYou know, on day one,\n\nit seemed like he was already signing executive orders.\n\nHelp us understand\n\nsome of the economic issues\n\nthat are related to the border and immigration.\n\nYeah.\n\nDeclaring a national emergency at the southern border.\n\nClosing down the CBP app\n\nfor migrants, ending,\n\nbirthright citizenship, and the list goes on.\n\nDeportations will\n\nfeature prominently.\n\nOn an average run rate per\n\nyear, there are roughly 500,000 deportations.\n\nWe can expect that number to rise.\n\nAnd however, we have to keep in mind, this will be adjudicated.\n\nThe president is testing the extent\n\nof his authority, legally.\n\nAnd we've already seen a number of court cases come through.\n\nThe second thing that's really important is spending\n\nis going to take money. Yeah.\n\nOr agents, judges,\n\nbeds, facilities which are already at capacity.\n\nSo we would anticipate\n\nand this is what we're hearing from Congress\n\nis that they're working on and some initial funding,\n\nadditional, you know, call it 80 to $90\n\nbillion of funding to work on the already processed folks\n\nwho have been identified as, likely to be deported.\n\nSo that that is something that we should be, anticipating,\n\ngoing the full extent\n\nof what the administration was proposing in the campaign.\n\nThe limit there is that.\n\nWell, then we'd have supply chain distortions in agriculture,\n\nfood processing, other lower skilled\n\nemployment, which would feed through to wages,\n\nwhich would then conflict\n\nwith what we talked about at the opening, which is inflation.\n\nThat's a more enduring inflation than tariffs.\n\nTariffs is a one time\n\nprice adjustment, could have some lingering inflation effects.\n\nIf we really saw what is what\n\ntoday is a reasonably tight labor market.\n\nWith, with a\n\nreally aggressive enforcement on deportations.\n\nThen we would likely see wage\n\ncost spiral start to, you know, eat into purchasing.\n\nPower or even an inability to fill those really important,\n\nhighly skilled jobs.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThat's a distortion.\n\nExactly. Right. Yeah.\n\nObviously something that,\n\nwe're talking about and people are thinking a lot about,\n\nwhen it comes to, that particular policy about immigration\n\nand then, you know,\n\nbut then you kind of look at the big picture\n\nand like,\n\nas you just mentioned, it all ties in like everything\n\nis, circular.\n\nIt's kind of\n\nthe jobs tie in to inflation\n\ntie into immigration, tied back into inflation.\n\nBut then there's the the normal sort of overlook\n\nabout the fiscal policy.\n\nSo Trump 1.0 obviously there were tariffs that were placed.\n\nWe're looking at.\n\nAnd Biden administration kept a lot of those on.\n\nNow we're looking to increase.\n\nBut also the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted.\n\nTrump and I think most of Congress right now\n\nwould like to see that continue in some form or fashion.\n\nBut they are\n\ninheriting the Trump administration,\n\na pretty sizable budget in the US.\n\nIt's double\n\nwhat it was in 2015 as a, you know, percentage of GDP.\n\nSo how are you thinking about fiscal policy in Trump 2.0?\n\nIt's going to be very different from the first.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou know, in the first we saw corporate rates\n\nstatutory level fall from 35 to 21%.\n\nEven if the corporate rate were to be lowered,\n\nwhich I think is a longshot, still,\n\nit wouldn't be lowered nearly\n\nthe to the extent that it was in the first round.\n\nRight.\n\nYou know, there the fiscal deficit\n\nas a share of GDP is double\n\nwhat it was in 2015.\n\nAnd the rise in interest rates\n\nmeans that interest costs now exceed defense spending.\n\nCongress is aware of this.\n\nThis is not something that is catching some of the more\n\nfiscally conservative, members of Congress by surprise.\n\nThey understand the dynamics.\n\nSo when you extend\n\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the price tag\n\nwith interest is close to $5 trillion over ten years.\n\nThat's pretty pretty pretty expensive.\n\nPretty extensive. Yeah.\n\nAnd it doesn't stimulate because it's just it's just keeping\n\ntax rates where they are.\n\nIt's not lowering them.\n\nSo, this is a really tricky situation.\n\nAnd when you factor in also demands on higher defense\n\nspending, spending on border security,\n\nother projects that need to get done,\n\nthere's even discussion about some salt tax relief\n\namong Republicans and that are in Congress from blue states\n\nand some of the promises\n\nthat they've made\n\nthat's going to cost money\n\nthat's above and beyond that initial 5 trillion.\n\nSo there's a lot of,\n\ntrading and, you know, sort of policy discussion.\n\nWhat deficit number are they going to be comfortable with?\n\nHow are we going to\n\nwork in raising the debt limit, which has to get done?\n\nThere's a whole funding the government,\n\nwhich was a problem over the holidays\n\nthat's going to come back in the middle of March.\n\nSo so, you know, this is going\n\nthere's there's going to be a number of fireworks.\n\nAnd the Republican Party still hasn't come to an agreement on\n\nare they going to use 1 or 2 bills on reconciliation\n\nto get the tax cuts across the line?\n\nSo there's a lot to hear from\n\neven tariffs.\n\nYou know, where we were just talking before, you know,\n\nmaybe this will be signed up as as revenue.\n\nMaybe this will be informally.\n\nMaybe it won't go through legislation.\n\nBut tariff revenue may be used as a way to offset\n\nsome of the spending.\n\nExpect that this is a discussion that's just taking shape now.\n\nIt's,\n\nvery unlikely\n\nthat lawmakers are going to want to vote for tariffs,\n\nbut they'll be happy to use some of the revenue from tariffs\n\nin order to fund some of these projects.\n\nSo, you know, bottom line on fiscal policy,\n\nnowhere near as stimulative as it was in Trump, 1.0\n\nwill be fortunate to get the tax cuts across the line,\n\nbecause if we don't, it's\n\na it's a very big problem for the economy.\n\nSo and I think as you point out rightly,\n\nCongress does want to achieve this, but the pathway is not clear\n\nat this point how they're going to get there.\n\nSometimes I think of our jobs as challenging, right?\n\nI think everybody has a day\n\nwhen they think my job\n\nis really challenging today,\n\nbut to be a politician in the United States right now,\n\nit's got to be one of the most challenging situations\n\nbecause there's so much that's up against them.\n\nAnd they have so much to do, and they have\n\nso many campaign promises to keep tough job.\n\nWe'll be tracking every move that they make for the next,\n\nyou know, at least two years before the midterm elections.\n\nBut, you know, lots to discuss there, Kurt.\n\nGreat way to end the conversation.\n\nGood to see you. Thanks for coming through.\n\nAnd we'll be reading more and more on what you and\n\nthe team will be writing about for the next four years.\n\nAgain, that website everybody is ubs.com/potus47.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nGood to see you too.\n\nGreat.

Year.\n\nCIO Alert: President Trump unveils second-term agenda\n 20 Jan 2025\nWhat happened?Donald Trump has been sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. In a wide-ranging inaugural address, President Trump made pledges on issues ranging from free speech to ownership of the Panama Canal. From an economic perspective, the agenda he laid out was in line with campaign promises, with pledges to bring down inflation, boost energy production, and levy tariffs on imports.Press reports citing an administration official indicated that President Trump would issue a broad memorandum directing federal agencies to investigate persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other countries. The memo singled out China’s compliance with the 2020 trade deal and the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set for review in 2026, as particular areas for scrutiny.US equity and bond markets were closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day public holiday. However, S\u0026P 500 futures rose by 0.4% and the US dollar index was down 1.2% at the time of writing, apparently on initial relief that President Trump had not issued executive orders imposing tariffs on his first day in office.What do we expect?President Trump’s policy agenda—if enacted in its entirety—would have significant macroeconomic repercussions. However, financial and political constraints are likely to mean that enacted policy risks falling short of campaign pledges in some instances. There is also the consideration that the President may “escalate to deescalate,” with some of his proposals likely to prove to be negotiating tactics.For example, the President declared a national emergency at the southern border and stated that the process of returning illegal immigrants would begin immediately. However, funding is currently not available for such a program, and reducing the labor supply through deportation could contribute to higher inflation.President Trump also pledged to increase oil production and fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). But the level of oil production is largely controlled by private companies, and there is currently no clear sign of changes in capital spending or drilling activity because of the election. Filling the SPR, meanwhile, would require additional funding from Congress, and there are physical constraints on how quickly it can be filled.Where the President enjoys more leeway is in the use of executive authority to impose tariffs on imports. Today’s use of a memorandum proposing scrutiny of current practices rather than the immediate imposition of fresh tariffs has reassured markets in the short term. But we believe it would be premature to assume that eventual new taxes on imports will be limited in size or scope.In our base case, we expect the effective tariff rate on China to rise to 25-30% (from 10% currently). We also expect measures to protect technological interests, rules limiting transshipment, and tariffs on EU autos and pharmaceuticals. Possible retaliations by China could include reciprocal tariffs, weakening the Chinese yuan, and restricting critical mineral exports.A risk case would include some combination of the imposition of universal tariffs on all US imports, particularly high tariffs on China (e.g., 60%), and/or meaningful and sustained tariffs on the US’s neighbors—Mexico and Canada.How do we invest?Our base case for the US economy is for “growth despite tariffs.” While we will be closely monitoring for risks, we do not believe that the tariff measures outlined in our base case would be sufficient to derail US growth. Nor do we believe that such tariffs would preclude inflation continuing to fall from current levels, enabling the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50bps later this year.Tariff risks, US fiscal policy concerns, and shifting expectations around inflation and Fed policy are likely to keep equity markets volatile in the near term. But we believe it is most likely that a combination of resilient US economic activity, solid earnings growth, lower borrowing costs, and the potential for greater capital markets activity will lead stocks higher over the balance of 2025. In our base case, we see the S\u0026P 500 reaching 6,600 by December.Meanwhile, long-end rates have moved higher since the US election owing to a repricing of Fed rate-cutting expectations and fiscal concerns. Yields have come off their peak in recent days, but we believe they still offer an attractive entry point to lock in yields. We favor high-quality segments, particularly government and investment grade bonds. In our base case, we expect the 10-year Treasury yield to fall to 4% in 2025.In currencies, elevated investor positioning and the dollar’s high valuation mean that we still see potential for dollar weakness over the balance of 2025. However, robust US economic data and ongoing uncertainty around the extent and nature of tariffs appear likely to keep the currency strong in the near term. In our base case, we forecast EURUSD at 1.02 in June and 1.06 in December.UBS Trending: What does Trump’s election win mean for business owners?\n 11 Dec 2024\nTrump's return to DC promises an economic rush—tax cuts, spending plans, and a more business-friendly regulatory environment.

Trending\n\nI'm Anthony Pastore.\n\nThank you so much for joining us\n\nhere in the studio with me\n\ntoday is Paul\n\nHsiao, asset\n\nallocation strategist\n\nwith the CIO.\n\nAmerica's Team.\n\nPaul great to have you back.\n\nNice to be here.\n\nSo you know, now\n\nwe're a couple of weeks\n\nafter the election.\n\nWe're starting\n\nto wrap our hands\n\na little bit around what Trump\n\n2.0 might look like.\n\nAnd I wanted to kind of start\n\nwith you\n\nand getting your thoughts on.\n\nWe know what's coming\n\nout of the last four years\n\nof the Biden-Harris\n\nadministration.\n\nNow going into Trump and Vance,\n\nwhat is the new administration\n\ninheriting from the previous one?\n\nRight.\n\nFrom an economic basis?\n\nActually, Trump 2024,\n\nit looks somewhat\n\nsimilar to Trump 2016,\n\nwhere he's inheriting an economy\n\nthat's in a more mature profile,\n\na cycle where unemployment\n\nrates are getting lower\n\nand things are actually\n\nquite good.\n\nThe Year Ahead report\n\npublished by CIO,\n\nwe're calling it the Roaring 20s.\n\nWe're already,\n\nyou know,\n\nabout four years through,\n\nand we're really seeing a period\n\nwhere growth is much better\n\nthan the last cycle\n\nafter the financial crisis.\n\nRight now, we're growing above\n\ntrend around 2.5%.\n\nInflation is around 2.5%.\n\nSo that means a real 5% economy.\n\nAnd we haven't really seen that\n\nsince the 1990s\n\nwhen productivity was rising.\n\nAnd it might continue\n\nwith the advent of AI\n\nand the continued\n\nadoption for that.\n\nAnd not only that,\n\nwe actually had the

2024.\n\nWith all this being said,\n\nthis is all before\n\nany potential expansionary\n\nfiscal plans at the Trump 2.0\n\nadministration might bring.\n\nSo that's the picture\n\nthat we're looking at, right.\n\nGood.\n\nThat's a great way\n\nto kind of broaden\n\nit out a little bit, you know.\n\nBut going deeply\n\nmaybe more specifically into\n\nsome of these\n\ncampaign conversations\n\nand you might call them\n\npromises from Trump\n\nand his supporters.\n\nThey were talking a lot\n\nabout tariffs.\n\nAnd even today in the news,\n\nwe're seeing that\n\nthey're already\n\nannouncing percentages\n\nfor countries\n\nlike China, Mexico, Canada,\n\nsome of our biggest\n\ntrade partners.\n\nWhat\n\nknowing what we know\n\nabout tariffs\n\nand how they potentially\n\ncould be inflationary.\n\nWhat should investors\n\nand particularly business owners\n\nbe on the lookout\n\nfor as they prepare\n\nfor potentially these tariffs\n\nhitting these countries?\n\nThat's a great question.\n\nAnd I think a lot\n\nhas been promised\n\nthroughout the campaign season.\n\nAnd since the election is over\n\nnow, we're taking a\n\nmore sober look into what Trump's\n\nfiscal plans might be.\n\nAnd broadly\n\nspeaking, we're\n\nputting them in three, you know,\n\npretty broad buckets\n\nfrom one tariffs, two taxes\n\nand then three immigration.\n\nRight.\n\nIn terms of the tariff front,\n\nI think, just like before,\n\na lot has been said by Trump,\n\nwe're going back\n\nto, you know,\n\npotential policy by tweet.\n\nBut right now, markets\n\nhaven't been affected\n\ntoo much by it.\n\nSo they're\n\nstill very much\n\nin wait and see mode.\n\nThey're wondering whether or not\n\nthis is just an opening move\n\nin a grand negotiation tactic,\n\nwhich, you know, is\n\nnot off the table as well.\n\nAnd I think that\n\nsome of the chatter is\n\na lot of world\n\nleaders would like to,\n\nyou know, cut a deal with Trump\n\neven before tariffs might happen.\n\nSo we\n\nwe think that\n\nthis might be a little less,\n\na little less\n\ndisturbing to the overall economy\n\nthan initially thought.\n\nWhat is more interesting,\n\nas you can see in the,\n\nin the chart here, is that\n\nthese are the potential impacts\n\nof what could\n\nTrump's tax policy be.\n\nAnd we think an easy win\n\ncould be extending\n\nhis initial policy of the Tax\n\nCuts and Jobs Act in 2017.\n\nThat's supposed to expire\n\nquite soon.\n\nSo an extension of that\n\nwould be a logical thing to do\n\nfor the second administration,\n\nor rather, his second term\n\nto do it first\n\nand then look\n\nat immigration plans.\n\nRight now\n\nwe're already seeing immigration,\n\nslowing down as the labor\n\nmarket softens up.\n\nSo having more\n\nrestrictive immigration\n\nright now,\n\nit might have had a more\n\ndisruption effect earlier\n\non the cycle,\n\nright after the pandemic,\n\nwhen you had a lot of businesses\n\nhiring very fast.\n\nSo less supply\n\nwould have constrained,\n\nthe amount of labor\n\nthat was able to get to hire.\n\nBut now that you see\n\nthe labor market softening a bit,\n\nand if immigration slows\n\nor even reverses,\n\nit's less disruptive\n\nbecause we're already\n\nin a pretty tight labor\n\nmarket, right?\n\nYou know,\n\nwhat's interesting\n\nis when you kind of look\n\nat some of the\n\ndifferent variables and even\n\nmaybe some of the caveats here,\n\nas we have a chart\n\nthat you put together\n\ntalking about how tariffs\n\ncould potentially lead\n\nto weaker growth\n\nand higher inflation.\n\nWhich means\n\nwe are going to be very closely\n\ntied to everything that\n\nJay Powell\n\nand the rest of the\n\nFederal Reserve\n\nare going to be saying\n\nas we go into 2025\n\nregarding rates.\n\nSo if rates still are on the path\n\nto continually come down,\n\nas we have here at CIO, we expect\n\nanother 25 basis points\n\nat the next meeting in December,\n\nplus another 100 next year.\n\nHow should business owners\n\nbe thinking about\n\nthat rate environment as we see\n\nit potentially\n\nnot changing\n\nfrom what our call\n\nwas just\n\nto a couple of months ago.\n\nI think that's a great question.\n\nRight now, our calls unchanged,\n\nwe still expect 100 basis points\n\nworth of cuts next year.\n\nBut when you have a rather\n\ntight economy\n\nthat's growing above trend\n\nand you want to stimulate it\n\nthrough fiscal expansion,\n\nwhether that's, more tax cuts,\n\nless stringent regulation,\n\ntariffs, to some extent,\n\nall these things,\n\nas you pointed out,\n\nare inflationary.\n\nSo that limits\n\nthe amount of rate cuts that,\n\nJay Powell can do.\n\nAnd I think markets\n\nhave already reacted to it.\n\nI'm just a couple of weeks ago\n\nI think futures\n\npricing for rate cuts next year\n\nwasn't too far off of our call,\n\nbut 100 basis points.\n\nNow it's about half with markets\n\nexpecting only 50 basis points\n\nnext year\n\ncompared to our call of 100.\n\nSo that's something\n\nthe policy path\n\nand the timing of it\n\nis something that I'm sure\n\nthe Federal Reserve\n\nas well as investors and we\n\nfrankly, are watching out for it\n\nand how it affect the markets\n\nfor next year. Right.\n\nAnd back to what you had before\n\nwith that chart\n\nabout the fiscal policies\n\nand the deficit.\n\nYou know,\n\nit looks like\n\nwe might potentially see $10.5\n\ntrillion in further deficits.\n\nAnd the question\n\nthen would become,\n\nyou know,\n\nwhat do we think\n\nabout how worried\n\nwe should be as investors\n\nor how worried business owners\n\nshould be\n\nif we see the deficit continue\n\nto widen at that rate?\n\nYeah, that's a good question too.\n\nAnd and I think\n\nan increasing question\n\nthat we're finding our clients\n\nasking us what is the path of,\n\nof sustained of debt\n\ndebts in the US\n\nand how much is too much\n\nas you saw\n\ngovernment debt really,\n\nexpand,\n\nespecially since the\n\nfinancial crisis,\n\nbut especially after Covid\n\nas it fiscal,\n\nour response tends to be a way,\n\nto to limit the impact\n\nof these of these disasters.\n\nAll these plans that is\n\ncome to fruition,\n\nas this graph shows, would\n\nadd trillions to the debt over\n\nthe next ten years.\n\nWhat we should keep in mind is\n\nwhat's the pathway,\n\nthe legislative pathway\n\nto get there.\n\nAnd if deficit hawks from\n\nthe Republican side\n\nwill even consider,\n\ntempering\n\nsome of the expectations.\n\nSo that's something worth\n\nkeeping in mind as well.\n\nUnknown variables\n\nthat are ahead of us.\n\nWe don't know\n\nexactly how it's\n\ngoing to be legislated. Right.\n\nBut but when we think about just\n\noverall debt sustainability,\n\nthe way we\n\nlike to think about it in CIO\n\nis that think about it\n\nmore of a chronic disease\n\nlike diabetes,\n\nand then a heart attack\n\nthat's acute and debilitating.\n\nIf a debt is\n\ncan be managed,\n\nfor the foreseeable future,\n\nso long as you have\n\nthese nominal growth rate\n\nkeeping up with it\n\nbeing higher than\n\ninterest payments.\n\nSo so long as that keeps up\n\nand then we're still on a path\n\nto sustainability in our opinion.\n\nRight. Great. Thanks, Paul.\n\nSo just as we're wrapping up,\n\nas we're talking about here,\n\nour CIO Year Ahead report\n\nis about the Roaring 20s,\n\nfour years\n\ninto the decade as we are.\n\nWhere do you see\n\nthe investment opportunities\n\nfor, you know,\n\nfor the average investor\n\ngiven our stance\n\non where we see\n\nthe rest of the decade going\n\nand what we expect from Trump\n\nand his 2.0\n\nadministration, right.\n\nRight now it looks like,\n\njust like the\n\nfirst administration.\n\nIt's very America first lead.\n\nSo the Trump administration,\n\nI think,\n\nwill tend to look at the stock\n\nmarket as a real time indicator\n\nof his approval of this,\n\nof his approval rating.\n\nAnd we think that\n\nthe most exciting\n\nopportunities in\n\nAI tend to be in the US.\n\nAnd that's why\n\nthat's part of the reason why,\n\nthe CIO still views\n\ntech as most attractive.\n\nSo I think,\n\nwith continued growth,\n\nwith opportunities in AI,\n\nI think, and earnings\n\nstill matching expectations,\n\nI think that justifies,\n\na call of overweight tech\n\nfor quite some time.\n\nTerrific.\n\nPaul, thank you very much.\n\nAnd I know we're still\n\nputting some charts\n\nup there about, the tariffs.\n\nAnd that's a bigger conversation\n\nthat I'm sure\n\nwe're going to get to\n\nthroughout the rest of this year\n\nand into next year,\n\nonce we even get more details\n\nabout what those tariffs\n\ncould potentially look like.\n\nBut thanks for taking us through.\n\nThis is a great run down.\n\nGood to see. My pleasure.\n\nThanks again.\n\nThank you Paul.\n\nCiao again\n\nfrom the chief\n\ninvestment Office here at UBS.\n\nAnd for more information\n\non anything coming out of CIO,\n\nyou can visit\n\nour website at ubs.com/views.\n\nPlus you can follow us\n\non social media.\n\nWe're on all the major channels,\n\nincluding Instagram.\n\nFollow us at UBS.\n\nTrending.\n\nLots of content there for you.\n\nAnd as always,\n\nif you have any questions\n\nabout what Paul\n\nand I spoke about today,\n\nmake sure that you are talking\n\nwith your financial advisor.\n\nUntil next time.\n\nI'm Anthony Pastore.\n\nWe wish you all a great rest\n\nof your day.\n\nAnd remember to keep your eyes\n\non what's trending.\n\nWe'll see you soon.\n\nUBS Trending: What might Trump's first 100 days look like?External view  |  09 Dec 2024\nThe United States is preparing for Donald Trump’s second turn at bat.

In 2020.\n\nSo how is all of that\n\nshowing up in his early moves.\n\nObviously we look at the\n\nthe cabinet picks,\n\nbut I would imagine that he and\n\nhis staff\n\nare already\n\nputting their agenda together\n\nfor the first 100 days\n\nin the white House\n\nafter the inauguration.\n\nExactly right.\n\nSo you look at\n\nfirst off the speed,\n\nand you reference this at 4\n\nor 5 times\n\nas fast as Biden and Obama.\n\nAnd he's\n\npushing, pushing, pushing.\n\nBut it's not just the cabinet,\n\nit's the sub cabinet.\n\nIt's other critical agencies.\n\nIt's regulators.\n\nHe's naming them all.\n\nNormally you don't see that until\n\nFebruary, March.\n\nThey have a slow process.\n\nNo.\n\nHe wants this done.\n\nAnd he's pressing Congress\n\nthe Republican leadership.\n\nGet ready guys.\n\nWe're moving.\n\nAnd so very specifically to that.\n\nHe's already talking to them\n\nabout the tax bill.\n\nWhat is it going to be two years?\n\nFour years.\n\nThey've been meeting over\n\nthe last 3 or 4 weeks.\n\nMarkets\n\nhaven't picked up on this.\n\nThey're discussing\n\nand debating this.\n\nThey're getting ready.\n\nThey get sworn in January 3rd.\n\nPresident Trump gets sworn\n\nin January 20th.\n\nHe wants them to work\n\nextremely hard\n\nand actually\n\ntry and get legislation\n\non his desk\n\nto sign on January 20th.\n\nWe've never seen that before.\n\nI mean,\n\nand as we know,\n\nthe current tax reform\n\nbill doesn't expire\n\nuntil the end of 2025.\n\nSo we're talking\n\nabout the same thing here.\n\nHe wants this done in January,\n\nwhich we know everything\n\nin politics takes months.\n\nBut right.\n\nYou know,\n\nthen it has to go\n\nto everyone's desks\n\nand it goes to the Senate.\n\nIt goes to the House.\n\nBut I think he's going to push.\n\nLook,\n\nI think it's going\n\nto be virtually impossible\n\nfor them to have the tax bill\n\nand the budget bill\n\ndone by the end of January.\n\nBut he's pushing them\n\nas soon as possible.\n\nIs it possible that\n\nwe get this done in February?\n\nYes. Wow.\n\nSo you're talking\n\nabout a reconciliation\n\npackage, right?\n\nThat weird thing, which\n\nfor all you golfers\n\nwho are listening to this,\n\nI refer to\n\nas sort of the version,\n\nit's like a mulligan, right?\n\nWhere you get to,\n\nyou can pass this thing,\n\nyou can't filibuster it,\n\nand you can only use it one time.\n\nIt's kind of that and that.\n\nAnd you will have the budget\n\nand the tax bill,\n\nand they will try and jam\n\nthis thing\n\nthrough as fast as possible.\n\nThat's big for the markets,\n\nfor fixed income\n\nin terms of what's\n\nwhere the deficit is.\n\nAnd very important for corporate\n\nand certainly individuals\n\non on the tax side. Yeah.\n\nTalk about getting ahead of it\n\nin record\n\nspeed as well, like you said,\n\nfor the markets themselves\n\nand for the analysts\n\nand investors out there\n\nto actually have a sense\n\nof knowing where it's\n\ngoing months before\n\nwe probably would have expected\n\nin the first place.\n\nIt's a big deal.\n\nIt's a huge deal.\n\nOne other thing I look at\n\nI've never seen a\n\nan incoming president\n\nmeeting with foreign leaders.\n\nYou had Prime Minister of Canada\n\ndown there.\n\nHe's having phone calls\n\nwith everybody.\n\nHe's not waiting.\n\nAnd therefore,\n\nanybody who's looking\n\nthis impacted in any way\n\nby tax or regulation,\n\nput on your your helmet\n\nand buckle up,\n\nbecause he's going to be moving\n\nas hard\n\nand as fast\n\nand harder and faster,\n\nI would argue,\n\nthan any other president\n\nwe've seen in recent history.\n\nYeah, I mean, it's like\n\nbecause you do have like\n\nyou said,\n\nhe had this\n\nfour years in between.\n\nNow with President Biden\n\nalmost coming\n\nto the end of his term\n\nto really consider\n\nwhat went wrong or right.\n\nHis first four years,\n\naccording to his constituents,\n\nand how the election\n\nwent in 2016.\n\nSo he's had all this time.\n\nIt's not like jumping right\n\nfrom first term to second term.\n\nIt's an interesting way\n\nto look at something\n\nthat you said.\n\nWe haven't seen it\n\nin our lifetimes. Exactly.\n\nSo with tax reform, etc.,\n\nwhat should we be\n\nwatching more closely out for?\n\nI mean, you said\n\nit might be a boon\n\nfor the fixed income markets\n\nor you know, if, for example, but\n\nshould we\n\nwhat should investors\n\nbe paying attention to\n\nif we do see\n\nthis tax bill get reconciled\n\nand rectified\n\nsometime before spring of 2025?\n\nKeep close to your advisor.\n\nI got to tell you. Right.\n\nIt's like,\n\nstay with the park ranger\n\nwhen you're walking through\n\nthe park,\n\nwhich has a lot of bears\n\nbecause there's a lot of bears\n\nall of a sudden. Right.\n\nThis this was\n\nthis was all safe territory.\n\nEverybody's thinking,\n\nwe're going to have a nice, quiet\n\nChristmas.\n\nWe'll get into the New year.\n\nWe'll slowly get going again\n\nin January. Nope.\n\nIt's coming.\n\nIt's go go go go.\n\nSo pay attention.\n\nTo what?\n\nThat you just read the papers,\n\nsee what they're talking about\n\non tax reform.\n\nBecause it is coming.\n\nAnd I'm sure you guys\n\nyou guys at UBS,\n\nyou're always ahead\n\nof the curve on this.\n\nStay close.\n\nYeah we definitely will.\n\nAnd of course we always\n\nencourage our investors\n\nand clients\n\nto talk to their face.\n\nSo thanks for\n\nreminding them of that,\n\nFrank, that just\n\nyou know, you did describe this\n\nas a two year window.\n\nAnd it's possible\n\nthat that is the case.\n\nWe could see as historically\n\na lot of times in those midterms,\n\nif you have one party controlling\n\neverything by the midterms,\n\nusually the voters are thinking,\n\nwell,\n\nmaybe we need to\n\nhave some more\n\nchecks and balances.\n\nSo really\n\nthere is a two year\n\npotentially to your window.\n\nSo I would imagine\n\nbesides tax reform in the budget,\n\nI'm sure we're going to see\n\na lot more, legislation\n\nlikely being pushed by Trump\n\nand his, his staff and,\n\nand the idea of having Elon\n\nMusk and Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nwith this, that look,\n\nthey're not a department\n\nin a classic sense, but they\n\nare advisors to the president,\n\nand they're going to\n\ncome up with a list.\n\nWe've seen this before, happen\n\nbefore this happened\n\nin the Reagan administration.\n\nW. R.\n\nGrace the Grace Commission.\n\nOkay. That was great.\n\nEven if you get 10% of those $2\n\ntrillion cuts,\n\nthese guys are very good\n\nat selling both Vivek and Elon.\n\nThey're going to be out there\n\nmaking clear\n\nto the American public,\n\nthese are waste of money.\n\nThis is how we can save money.\n\nThis are going to bring the\n\nthat will be the other thing\n\nand that will be\n\nan ongoing battle,\n\nI would argue, over\n\nthe next two years,\n\nwhich could seriously reshape,\n\nthe federal government\n\nand how we are doing things.\n\nIncredible.\n\nYeah, there's a lot\n\nthat we're going\n\nto have to pay attention\n\nto for, clearly,\n\nfor the reasons\n\nthat you're saying.\n\nAnd as we keep\n\nreminding everybody,\n\nit is happening\n\nat significantly faster\n\nspeeds than we've ever seen.\n\nSo there's a lot\n\nthat we have to catch up\n\nto very quickly, very quickly.\n\nI mean, we are in\n\na communications age\n\nthat is, you know,\n\nwe're so used to it\n\nat this point,\n\nsuper texting and everything.\n\nSure. Now it's hit government.\n\nYeah, right.\n\nDonald Trump\n\ntweets something out at 10:30.\n\nBoom.\n\nThe markets are all over it\n\nthe next morning. Right.\n\nHe is and he is moving things.\n\nSo this is where we are.\n\nAnd we have people.\n\nThe head of Twitter is now\n\nadvising on\n\nhow to cut back the governments.\n\nRight.\n\nYou think he's\n\nnot going to use that platform\n\nto really detail\n\nwhere we can cut?\n\nWe'll have that debate.\n\nMaybe some of these things\n\nshouldn't be done.\n\nMaybe they should.\n\nBut I think that's\n\nthe fascinating\n\nnew aspect of this\n\nis that\n\nwe can really drill into this.\n\nIt doesn't take months,\n\ndoesn't take years.\n\nIt'll take days, days.\n\nAnd you take\n\nput artificial intelligence\n\ninto this\n\nin terms of cutting the numbers,\n\nanalyzing everything else.\n\nAgain, we're talking\n\nseconds, minutes instead of days\n\nand weeks.\n\nYeah, we barely scratched\n\nthe surface\n\non that discussion,\n\nwhich is how does AI\n\nthe or the future of AI and,\n\nyou know, generative\n\nAI and all these,\n\nyou know,\n\nkind of large language models,\n\nhow is that going\n\nto potentially impact legislation\n\nand the speed of which\n\nwe can expect to be,\n\nlike you said, in just a day,\n\nyou could have so much\n\nthat changes\n\nbecause of the technology.\n\nIn the arcane world of lobbying.\n\nWhat does this do for lobbying\n\nin terms of analysis\n\nof a piece of legislation\n\nthat's written,\n\nand you bring\n\nartificial intelligence\n\nto come in and analyze\n\nthe cost benefit analysis,\n\nhow many jobs will be impacted\n\npositive and any negatively?\n\nWell, there's\n\nthis what would take\n\nmonths and months at a think tank\n\nwill take minutes.\n\nDays a day at most.\n\nYeah, this changes\n\nhow lobbying works.\n\nSo all of a sudden\n\nwe could see an injection\n\nof speed into what is always\n\nbeen the slow molasses roll\n\nof how\n\nhow legislation\n\nor even regulation is done.\n\nI think most people think\n\nof anything happening in\n\nthe government is trying\n\nto turn the Titanic around,\n\nbut I think it's going\n\nto turn into more\n\nlike trying\n\nto turn a jet ski around,\n\nwhich happens in a half a second.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd it can flip\n\nif you don't do it right.\n\nGod, that's the perfect way\n\nto end our conversation, Frank.\n\nThank you very much.

Note that the tactical asset allocation (TAA) positioning of our different investment strategies may differ from these views due to factors including portfolio construction, concentration, and borrowing constraints.Most attractive – We consider this asset class to be among the most attractive. Investors should seek opportunities to add exposure.Attractive – We consider this asset class to be attractive. Consider opportunities in this asset class.Neutral – We do not expect outsized returns or losses. Hold longer-term exposure.Unattractive – We consider this asset class to be unattractive. Consider alternative opportunities.Least attractive – We consider this asset class to be among the least attractive. Seek more favorable alternative opportunities.Note: For equities, we have collapsed “Most Attractive” with “Attractive” and “Least Attractive” with “Unattractive” from the five-tier rating system that is found in the Equity Compass into three tiers.Nontraditional asset classes are alternative investments that include hedge funds, private equity, real estate, and managed futures (collectively, alternative investments). Interests of alternative investment funds are sold only to qualified investors, and only by means of offering documents that include information about the risks, performance and expenses of alternative investment funds, and which clients are urged to read carefully before subscribing and retain. An investment in an alternative investment fund is speculative and involves significant risks. Specifically, these investments (1) are not mutual funds and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds; (2) may have performance that is volatile, and investors may lose all or a substantial amount of their investment; (3) may engage in leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss; (4) are long-term, illiquid investments; there is generally no secondary market for the interests of a fund, and none is expected to develop; (5) interests of alternative investment funds typically will be illiquid and subject to restrictions on transfer; (6) may not be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors; (7) generally involve complex tax strategies and there may be delays in distributing tax information to investors; (8) are subject to high fees, including management fees and other fees and expenses, all of which will reduce profits.Interests in alternative investment funds are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other governmental agency. Prospective investors should understand these risks and have the financial ability and willingness to accept them for an extended period of time before making an investment in an alternative investment fund, and should consider an alternative investment fund as a supplement to an overall investment program.In addition to the risks that apply to alternative investments generally, the following are additional risks related to an investment in these strategies:Hedge Fund Risk: There are risks specifically associated with investing in hedge funds, which may include risks associated with investing in short sales, options, small-cap stocks, “junk bonds,” derivatives, distressed securities, non-US securities and illiquid investments.Managed Futures: There are risks specifically associated with investing in managed futures programs. For example, not all managers focus on all strategies at all times, and managed futures strategies may have material directional elements.Real Estate: There are risks specifically associated with investing in real estate products and real estate investment trusts. They involve risks associated with debt, adverse changes in general economic or local market conditions, changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws or regulations, risks associated with capital calls and, for some real estate products, the risks associated with the ability to qualify for favorable treatment under the federal tax laws.Private Equity: There are risks specifically associated with investing in private equity. Capital calls can be made on short notice, and the failure to meet capital calls can result in significant adverse consequences including, but not limited to, a total loss of investment.Foreign Exchange/Currency Risk: Investors in securities of issuers located outside of the United States should be aware that even for securities denominated in US dollars, changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the issuer’s “home” currency can have unexpected effects on the market value and liquidity of those securities. Those securities may also be affected by other risks (such as political, economic or regulatory changes) that may not be readily known to a US investor.\n                        Your home for POTUS 47 coverage\n                    \n                        Find recent reports, video conversations, and more, all in one place.",
