The Federal Reserve expects to recover 108 percent of actual and imputed expenses in 2026, including the return on equity that would have been earned if a private-sector firm provided the services. Overall, price changes for 2026 will result in an estimated 0.9 percent average price increase for established, mature services.\n\nThe entire 2026 fee schedule is published on FRBservices.org®. Additional information on the Federal Reserve's payments services, including service usage statistics, is available on the Board's website.\n\nFor media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                            Federal Register notice: Federal Reserve Bank Services (PDF)\n                        \n                                    \n                             \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        Last Update:\n            December 04, 2025",
