Additionally, non-banks account for half of daily foreign exchange market turnover, more than double their share of 25 years earlier.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore the latest regulatory insights with our outlooks, webinars, research and analysis.\t\t\t\t\tSign up\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\tRegulatory implications\nUnlike banks, nonbanks mostly operate under lighter prudential regulation and often provide limited disclosure of their assets, leverage, and liquidity which makes vulnerabilities and interconnections harder to detect.\n\nThe IMF notes the approach of regulators in the UK and Australia where they have begun integrating system-wide stress tests and scenario analysis to better understand the dynamics at play.\nFor banks, the IMF underscores the importance of implementing the Basel III standards and advancing recovery and resolution frameworks to safeguard the sector against contagion from weak banks.\nFor non-banks, the IMF calls for enhanced supervision through more extensive data collection, improving forward-looking analysis, and strengthening co-ordination between supervisors.\nThe IMF calls for improving and expanding the availability and usability of liquidity management tools for open-ended investment funds to address pressures and forced bond sales by non-banks.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOJK issues two new regs on capital and liquidity structure\nOJK Strengthens Capital and Liquidity Structure with Two New Regulations for Islamic Banks\nSummary\nJakarta, October 31, 2025 — The Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK) has issued two new regulations aimed at enhancing the resilience and competitiveness of the national Islamic banking industry:\n\nOJK Regulation (POJK) No. 20 of 2025 on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for Islamic Commercial Banks (BUS) and Islamic Business Units (UUS).\nOJK Regulation (POJK) No. 21 of 2025 on the Leverage Ratio for Islamic Commercial Banks.\n\nThese regulations reinforce capital structure, liquidity management, and long-term funding for Islamic banks, aligning Indonesia’s Islamic finance system with international standards under Basel III and the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB).\nIn more detail\nPOJK No. 20 of 2025 – Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nThis regulation requires Islamic Commercial Banks (BUS) and Islamic Business Units (UUS) to maintain both the LCR and NSFR at a minimum of 100 percent, ensuring robust short-term liquidity and stable long-term funding. Implementation will be phased in from 2026 to 2028 in line with industry readiness.\nThe rule mandates regular calculation, monitoring, and reporting of liquidity and funding adequacy — both on an individual and consolidated basis — to ensure transparent and measured liquidity risk management.\nModeled after Basel III: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and The Net Stable Funding Ratio, and guided by IFSB’s Guidance Note GN-6, this regulation aims to align Indonesia’s Islamic banking framework with international best practices.\nUltimately, this is expected to enhance liquidity discipline, improve asset–liability composition, and strengthen banks’ ability to withstand multiple stress scenarios — all without compromising their intermediation function.\nThis initiative is part of the 2023–2027 Islamic Banking Development and Strengthening Roadmap (RP3SI), particularly under Pillar I (industry resilience) and Pillar V (regulation, licensing, and supervision).\nPOJK No. 21 of 2025 – Leverage Ratio\nThis regulation introduces a new capital adequacy indicator to strengthen the resilience of Islamic Commercial Banks by requiring a minimum leverage ratio of 3 percent, consistent with global Basel III and IFSB-23 standards.\nThe leverage ratio enhances the industry’s awareness of maintaining proportional business growth relative to its capital base, independent of risk-weighted asset adjustments. This helps banks anticipate potential deleveraging impacts across various scenarios.\nThe regulation, effective September 17, 2025, requires:\n\nFirst reporting: end of Q1 2026\nFirst public disclosure: September 2026\nBanks failing to meet the minimum threshold must submit a corrective action plan to OJK. Non-compliance may result in administrative sanctions, including fines or non-monetary penalties.\n\nThis move supports the creation of a strong capital foundation for Islamic Commercial Banks, enabling a healthy, globally competitive, and resilient Islamic banking system.\nNext steps\n\nFor BUS and UUS:\n\nBegin internal readiness assessments for LCR, NSFR, and leverage ratio calculations.\nDevelop systems and processes for phased reporting between 2026–2028.\nIntegrate risk management frameworks aligned with Basel III and IFSB standards.\n\n\n\n\nFor OJK:\n\nContinue supervision and capacity building to ensure smooth transition and compliance.\nFacilitate harmonization of Islamic financial reporting and monitoring tools.\n\n\n\nThese new regulations mark a significant milestone in building a resilient, efficient, and internationally competitive Islamic banking ecosystem in Indonesia.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHKMA consults on new capital requirements for cryptoasset exposures\nThe HKMA is seeking industry feedback on a proposed prudential framework for cryptoasset exposures held by locally incorporated authorized institutions, aligning with global standards.\nIn more detail\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a letter to consult the banking industry on proposed changes to the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module CA-G-1, on the capital adequacy regime.\nThe proposal introduces a comprehensive prudential framework for Authorized Institutions’ (AIs) exposures to cryptoassets. It outlines a risk-based approach by categorizing cryptoassets into different groups, assigning differentiated capital treatments. New sections covering the topic include “Credit risk (cryptoasset exposures)” and”Calculation of risk-weighted amounts of cryptoasset exposures.” The revisions are designed to align the capital adequacy requirements with international Basel III standards and also cover derivatives, market risk, and infrastructure-related exposures.\nWhat’s next\nThe consultation period is open until November 24, and the HKMA currently anticipates the revised standards to be implemented starting January 1, 2026.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUK and Switzerland publish guidance for firms on the Berne Financial Services Agreement (BFSA)\nSummary\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have issued joint guidelines for UK and Swiss firms on implementing the Berne Financial Services Agreement (BFSA). The BFSA establishes mutual recognition of financial services regulation between the UK and Switzerland, allowing cross-border provision of wholesale financial services based on deference to each jurisdiction’s supervisory frameworks. The guidance clarifies notification procedures, eligibility criteria, and reporting obligations for firms operating under the new regime. Similarly, Switzerland’s financial regulator FINMA also published guidelines for interested institutions.\nContext\nThe BFSA represents the first bilateral financial services agreement of its kind between the UK and Switzerland since Brexit, formalising regulatory cooperation and equivalence across key sectors such as investment and insurance services. It aims to simplify market access for wholesale and high-net-worth clients while maintaining robust prudential standards and investor protection. The framework also strengthens supervisory collaboration among the FCA, PRA, Bank of England, and Switzerland’s FINMA.\nKey takeaways\n\nMutual Recognition Framework: Each country recognises the other’s regulatory and supervisory systems as achieving equivalent outcomes in covered sectors, promoting market integrity and financial stability.\nSwiss Investment Services Firms:\n\nMay provide cross-border investment and ancillary services to UK wholesale clients and high-net-worth individuals without UK authorisation, subject to notification and registration via FINMA’s EHP platform.\nMust meet conditions on client disclosures, annual reporting (by 30 April), and suitability tests for high-net-worth clients.\nRequired to obtain client consent for regulatory information sharing and ensure segregation of client assets when using sub-custodians.\n\n\n\n\nUK Insurance Firms:\n\nMay offer certain general insurance services into Switzerland without Swiss authorisation, provided they meet solvency and prudential standards equivalent to Solvency II and are registered with FINMA.\nMust report annually to FINMA (copied to PRA/FCA) and confirm that services are also offered outside Switzerland.\nRetail and life insurance are excluded; only large corporate clients (meeting at least two of turnover, balance sheet, or employee thresholds) are in scope.\n\n\n\n\nUK Investment Services Firms:\n\nMust notify the FCA before providing investment services into Switzerland through client advisers on a temporary basis and comply with disclosure obligations for Swiss clients.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nFirms seeking to rely on the BFSA must complete the relevant notification process (via FCA Connect or FINMA’s EHP system) before providing services.\n\nAnnual reporting deadlines begin in April 2026, covering the 2025 reporting year.\nThe FCA and PRA will publish corresponding rule amendments disapplying conflicting domestic provisions to give full effect to the BFSA.\nBoth regulators encourage firms to review their governance, client disclosure processes, and cross-border operational structures ahead of implementation.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet insights delivered to your inbox\t\t\t\t\tSign up for Bloomberg Professional Services newsletter",
