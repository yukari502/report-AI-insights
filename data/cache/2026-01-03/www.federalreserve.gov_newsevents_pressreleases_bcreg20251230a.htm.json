Financial institutions are evaluated under different CRA examination procedures based upon their asset-size classification. The asset-size thresholds are adjusted annually based on the average change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), which is a measure of inflation.\n\nAs a result of the 2.51 percent increase in the CPI-W for the period ending in November 2025, the CRA asset-size thresholds for small banks and intermediate small banks are:\n\n\n\tA small bank is an institution that, as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years, had assets of less than $1.649 billion.\n\n\n\n\tAn intermediate small bank is a small institution with assets of at least $412 million as of December 31 of both of the prior two calendar years and less than $1.649 billion as of December 31 of either of the prior two calendar years.\n\n\nThese thresholds are in effect from the latter of January 1, 2026 or the date of publication in the Federal Register through December 31, 2026. A list of the current and historical asset-size thresholds is available here.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                            Federal Register notice: Community Reinvestment Act Regulations Asset-Size Thresholds (PDF)\n                        \n                                    \n                              \n                \n                             \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        Last Update:\n            December 30, 2025",
