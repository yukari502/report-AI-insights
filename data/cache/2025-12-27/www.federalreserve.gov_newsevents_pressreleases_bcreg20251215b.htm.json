The rules implementing these requirements contain an exemption for loans at or below a threshold amount that is adjusted annually to reflect CPI-W increases.\n                \n                \n                        \n                            \n                            Read the Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans Exemption Threshold \n                        \n                                    \n                              \n                \n                             \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        Last Update:\n            December 16, 2025",
