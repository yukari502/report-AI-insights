Transactions at or below the thresholds are subject to the protections of the regulations.\n\nSpecifically, based on the 2.1 percent annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2025, Regulation Z and Regulation M generally will apply to consumer credit transactions and consumer leases of $73,400 or less in 2026. However, private education loans and loans secured by real property, such as mortgages, are subject to Regulation Z regardless of the amount of the loan.\n                \n                                \n                              \n                \n                             \n            \n            \n        \n    \n        Last Update:\n            December 15, 2025",
