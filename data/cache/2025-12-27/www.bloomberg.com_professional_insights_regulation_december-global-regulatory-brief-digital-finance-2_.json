He discussed how automation, data, and AI are transforming the way markets operate, stressing the importance of human expertise and adaptability to ensure these technologies are used responsibly and effectively. He also emphasized that collaboration across the industry can help market participants navigate the challenges ahead.\nContext\nThe FCA acknowledges that dramatic technological change is taking place that has the potential to transform the wider financial services sector. This speech builds on the FCA’s view that the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics presents significant opportunities for innovation in financial markets, while also amplifying risks that need to be managed appropriately.\nKey takeaways\n\nHolland noted that AI does not introduce new risks, but rather amplifies existing ones (especially around explainability, data quality, and model validation). He stressed that regulation and policy must develop at the same pace as technology, ensuring that innovation is matched by effective oversight and clear expectations for firms.\nHe emphasised that, despite advances in automation, human judgement, skill, and collaboration remain vital in interpreting data, managing complexity, and maintaining effective market supervision.\nWith respect to the FCA’s own use of advanced analytics, Holland highlighted that the FCA’s Market Oversight function processes vast quantities of market data each day and must continue evolving its systems and analytical capabilities to extract meaningful insights that support supervisory work.\nHe also called for continued cooperation between regulators, market participants, and technology providers to share knowledge, develop robust systems, and ensure innovation benefits and opportunities are harnessed by the wider industry.\n\nNext steps\nHolland confirmed that the FCA will soon publish a Consultation Paper seeking views on improving the UK’s transaction reporting regime; a core component of its data-driven supervision model. The FCA will also continue to invest in data and technology capabilities to enhance market oversight, while maintaining focus on human judgement and governance as essential elements of effective regulation.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore the latest regulatory insights with our outlooks, webinars, research and analysis.\t\t\t\t\tSign up\t\t\t\t\n\n    \t\t\t\n\t\t\tMAS updates guide on the tokenization of capital markets products\nSummary\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has updated its regulatory guide on tokenized capital markets products (CMPs), clarifying how securities laws apply to digital tokens. The revised guide, released on 14 November 2025, replaces the earlier Digital Token Offerings (DTO) Guide and reflects evolving market practices and technologies.\nContext\nOriginally published in 2017 and updated in 2020, the DTO Guide provided guidance on digital token offerings under MAS-administered laws. The latest update responds to growing interest in tokenizing CMPs and the expansion of token-related activities across the capital markets value chain, including trading, settlement, and custody.\nKey takeaways\n\nTechnology-Neutral Approach: MAS continues to assess tokenized CMPs based on their economic substance rather than technological form.\nRegulatory Scope: Tokenised CMPs are subject to the same requirements under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and Financial Advisers Act (FAA) as traditional CMPs.\nDisclosure Requirements: Issuers must disclose token-specific risks and characteristics, including DLT architecture, smart contracts, custody arrangements, and legal rights.\nLicensing Obligations: Entities involved in issuance, trading, custody, or advisory services related to tokenised CMPs may require MAS licences unless exempted.\nAML/CFT Compliance: MAS reiterates the applicability of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations to token-related activities.\nExtra-Territorial Reach: MAS regulations may apply to overseas activities with substantial effects in Singapore.\nCase Studies: The guide includes 17 illustrative case studies to help entities assess whether their tokens qualify as CMPs.\n\nNext steps\n\nEntities planning to issue or offer digital tokens in Singapore should:\n\nSeek legal advice from Singapore-qualified counsel.\nReview the guide and case studies to determine regulatory obligations.\nIf necessary, submit an enquiry to MAS using the checklist in Appendix 3.\n\n\n\n\nMAS may issue further updates to the guide as tokenization practices evolve.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nThe Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has selected six participants for the inaugural cohort of its Regulatory Sandbox, aimed at fostering innovation in the capital market. The sandbox provides a controlled environment for testing new products and services that enhance market vibrancy and inclusiveness.\nContext\nThe Regulatory Sandbox was launched during the SCxSC Fintech Summit in 2024 as part of SC’s innovation toolkit. Applications for participation were open between 15 April and 31 May 2025, attracting strong interest from diverse market players.\nKey takeaways\n\nParticipants and Themes:\n\nAlternative Real Estate Investments: Wahed X Sdn Bhd (Wahed) and Urban NX Sdn Bhd (Urby)\nSecondary Market Innovation: Kapital DX Sdn Bhd (KLDX) and Pitch Platforms Sdn Bhd (PSTX 2.0)\nAlternative Financing: Virtual Economy Technology Sdn Bhd (V Systems) and PeerHive (M) Sdn Bhd (PeerHive)\n\n\nSeveral participants will leverage advanced data analytics and blockchain to improve due diligence and introduce new operating models.\nTesting will occur over approximately 12 months, starting in two batches: January 2026 or July 2026, depending on readiness.\nThe sandbox aims to balance innovation with investor protection, supporting responsible experimentation under defined parameters.\n\nNext steps\n\nParticipants will begin testing in early or mid-2026.\nCorporations with innovative business models can engage with the SC through the Alliance of FinTech Community (aFINity) by submitting proposals to afinity@seccom.com.my.\nFurther details on the sandbox framework are available via SC’s official resources.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThe Australian government publishes its National AI Plan\nThe Australian government announces that the Australian government is releasing the National AI Plan, ‘a comprehensive roadmap to build an AI-enabled economy that harnesses the full potential of artificial intelligence for the benefit of all Australians’.\nFurther detail\nThe National AI Plan has three goals:\n\nCapturing the opportunities, including attracting investment in Australia’s digital and physical infrastructure, supporting local capability, and positioning Australia as a leading destination for future AI investment.\nSpreading the benefits, including improving public services, supporting AI adoption and building skills across the economy, including for not-for-profits, universities, schools, TAFEs and community organisations.\nKeeping Australians safe, including through setting up the recently announced AI Safety Institute to monitor, test and share information on emerging AI capabilities, risks and harms, which builds on our commitment to robust legal, regulatory, and ethical frameworks and engaging internationally to protect rights and build trust.\n\nThe plan noted that Australia has strong protections in place to address many risks, but the technology is fast-moving and regulation must keep pace. That’s why the government continues to assess the suitability of existing laws in the context of AI. The government is taking action to identify and understand how AI risks deal with specific harms, including reviews and regulations relating to online harms, copyright law, AI use in healthcare and consumer protections.\nThe announcement was backed by a $29.9 million commitment to establish the AI Safety Institute in early 2026 to ensure that the government is monitoring and responding to risks, supporting agencies and regulators.\nStated the Minister of Science: ‘The National AI Plan is about making sure technology serves Australians, not the other way around…As the technology continues to evolve, we will continue to refine and strengthen this plan to seize new opportunities and act decisively to keep Australians safe”.\nThe Business Council of Australia called the plan “an important step forward [that] charts a clear direction for how Australia can embrace AI to boost productivity, sharpen our competitiveness and raise living standards”.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n    \t\t\t\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet insights delivered to your inbox\t\t\t\t\tSign up for Bloomberg Professional Services newsletter",
