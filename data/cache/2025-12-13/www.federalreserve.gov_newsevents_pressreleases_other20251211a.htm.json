In December 2024, the board of directors of each Reserve Bank, representing a wide range of business and community leaders across each district, started a process to assess their president and first vice president across several performance dimensions. Those factors included:\n\n\n\tThe president's active engagement with the local business, financial, and non-profit communities within the district;\n\tTheir effectiveness as the chief executive officer of the Reserve Bank, including developing and implementing the Bank's strategy and leading its staff; and\n\tTheir leadership contributions to the Federal Reserve System as a whole, notably in supporting coordinated System functions and activities.\n\n\nFirst vice presidents were largely evaluated in their role as the chief operating officer of each Reserve Bank, with a focus on their management of both local Reserve Bank operations and Federal Reserve System initiatives.\n\nIn preparing its overall assessment of each president and first vice president, each board of directors solicited input from a range of parties, including civic and industry leaders in each district. As a final step in the process, the Federal Reserve Board considered the evaluation by the board of directors.\n\nThe new five-year term begins on March 1, 2026.
