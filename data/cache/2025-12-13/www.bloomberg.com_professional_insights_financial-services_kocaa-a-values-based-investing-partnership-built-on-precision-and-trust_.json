  "content": "Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKnights of Columbus Asset Advisors (KoCAA) is a faith-driven investment advisory firm managing approximately $29.5 billion in assets. With a mission to provide Catholic-compliant investment solutions, KoCAA serves the investment needs of its parent company, the Knights of Columbus, as well as a growing number of institutional and individual investors across the United States.  \nThe firm’s strategy spans both fixed income and equity, with every investment screened in accordance with the ethical guidelines set forth by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. \n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFEATURED PRODUCTS\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \n                \n        \n            \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nINDUSTRY\nAsset Management\nLOCATION\nNew Haven, Connecticut\nGOAL\nFinding a benchmark that accurately mirrors the company’s investable universe\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKey insights\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\tTraditional market benchmarks failed to reflect the company’s constraints and intentions behind its portfolios, creating murkiness and making performance comparisons difficult. \n\n\n\t\t\t\tCollaboration with Bloomberg resulted in highly customized indexes tailored to serve the needs of the company’s clients. \n\n\n\t\t\t\tBloomberg’s index solution was more cost-effective, without compromising on quality or service. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n      The Bloomberg team has been highly collaborative, interested in getting stuff done, wants to work with us to make sure that we’re getting what we need.\n\n\n          James Gaul\n          Vice President and Portfolio Manager, KoCAA\n        \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSituation\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tKoCAA is carefully filtering investments to align with faith-based mandates. Over the past two years the company’s monthly inflows doubled from $15 million to $30 million. Like many values-driven firms, KoCAA faced a persistent challenge. Traditional market benchmarks failed to reflect the constraints and intentions behind its portfolios. Standard indexes that included companies that KoCAA would never invest in for ethical reasons made performance comparisons difficult and, in many cases, misleading. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFiltering investments to align with faith-based mandates\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncreased demand for portfolios that reflect clients' personal or organizational convictions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProblem\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tExisting index providers offered limited solutions, which were often expensive, inflexible, or misaligned with KoCAA’s needs.

Bloomberg brought both its proprietary data and third-party sources to the table, ensuring that the benchmark would reflect Catholic social and moral teaching with a high degree of precision. KoCAA also benefitted from the Bloomberg Industry Classification System (BICS), which allowed for detailed, hierarchical industry definitions that gave the company the control it needed down to the subsector level. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBuilt a tailored benchmark\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDeveloped precise screening using BICS industry definitions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n      Now we can spend our time focusing on decisions that we made and how that relates to performance, rather than benchmark structure, which is outside our control.\n\n\n          Nick Gentile\n          Interim President and Chief Investment Officer, KoCAA\n        \n\n\n\n\t\t\tAccess the full report\nPlease complete the form to gain access to the full report.\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRelated Content\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.
